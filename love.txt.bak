Field – Ext. – Night
It’s winter, at the twilight hour said to lie between dog and wolf.
An unreal atmosphere. Clumps of blackened earth absorb the
colour of the frost that covers it in patches.
Wisps of marbled air rise over the field, mirroring it in
bizarre continuity.
A landscape bereft of horizon, drained of colour, bloodless, glacial,
bathed in a strange inconsistency.
We hear the engine drone of a small plane before it becomes visible,
flying at low altitude.

Plane – Int. – Night
Inside the cabin the pilot anxiously scrutinizes the luminous dials
on his instrument panel. He checks his flight plan and turns on
the radio handset.

69

PILOT
This is Malibu calling Frankfurt II, Malibu calling...
A brusque hand cuts the contact, leaving the pilot appearing taken
aback momentarily. The hand belongs to a guy in his fifties, Fred,
whose black leather jacket reinforces his burly physique.
FRED
Forget the control tower, this is our stop.
PILOT
Are you crazy?
With the gesture of a police detective, Fred flashes a card in the
pilot’s face.
PILOT
What are you. Some kind of cop?
(He reads the card ). Wait a minute, that’s a press card.
FRED (with a snigger)
Don’t you know journalists hold all the cards?
He thrusts the hand in his gun pocket, the pilot momentarily takes
fright, but instead of a weapon he extracts a wallet stuffed with
dollar bills. With calculated slowness, he lobs a wad of fifties onto
the instrument panel, then a second and a third; on the fourth, a
sudden jolt knocks all the money to the floor. The defeated pilot
bends to gather it up. Fred helps him, nonchalantly using his shoe
like a croupier’s rake. We catch this shamefully crouched figure
casting an anxious glance towards the rear passenger compartment.
A limp body occupies one of the four seats, the body of a young man
with his head and upper torsoe slumped over the armrest. Below
him a small monkey jumps around tugging at his drooping locks.

70

FRED
That kid is probably more important than the rest of us five
billion monkeys put together.
(To the monkey) Leave him alone, Lara.
The monkey jumps back onto its master’s shoulder as he limps, stiff
legged, towards the passenger seat. Carefully he rights the young
man’s body, cradling his head protectively.
FRED
Axel, can you hear me?
No response. The journalist sweeps Axel’s hair back from his forehead and runs his fingers through it. A handsome face, despite the
dark circles under the eyes, which are closed. The plane rolls into
a turn as the pilot prepares to land. Axel’s eyelids open, he looks
around but makes no response and drifts back into unconsciousness.
The wheels hit the ground hard, jolting the plane this way and
that before it finally comes to rest.
The pilot shouts over the noise of the engine.
PILOT
Hurry up and get the hell out of here.
FRED
We’d be quicker if you gave me a hand.
PILOT
Oh, I’m sure a journalist like you can handle it.
Fred gives him a contemptuous shrug and reaches for the lever to
open the door. The icy blast of air that greets him sends a shiver

71

through his whole body as he peers out at the dense sheet of mist
floating above the field. The monkey perched on his shoulder
begins to tremble. He bundles her under his jacket.
Axel’s seat is empty. The shock of the landing has knocked him
to the ground. At first all we see are his two bare feet. Fred grabs
hold of them and drags his body towards him. He is wearing only
a sweatshirt and jeans. To protect his head the journalist grips him
from underneath the arms.
Fred, his bag, the monkey and Axel are hardly out the door
when the pilot slams it shut and revs up the engine. The plane
taxis off and disappears into the fog.

Opening music and credits
The strange spectacle of the lame journalist dragging Axel through
the mist.

Main Road – Ext. – Night
Night has fallen by the time Fred reaches the field’s edge. We hear the
sound of traffic coming from a main road a little way below them.
Exhausted, Fred lets go of Axel, careful to slip his bag under the
young man’s head as he slumps to the ground. Sweating profusely
despite the cold, he wipes his face and neck with a handkerchief.
He inspects their surroundings before deciding to leave Axel alone,
heading off in the direction of a service station whose lights he has
seen some hundred yards or so farther down, on the other side of the
road. Unable to make a dash across the heavily trafficked highway,
Fred forces a passage between the oncoming drivers, causing them
to brake and veer dangerously to avoid him. The air fills with the
sound of angry car horns. Axel sits up to see what’s gong on.

72

Service Station – Int. – Night
In the station shop, the racks of gadgets, car accessories and sweets
lie deserted. Strangely, all the customers are huddled round the cash
register. Anxiously, they listen to a newsflash from a transistor radio.
VOICE-OFF SPEAKER
...This is Dieter Magen of Radio Frankfurt. The radio interference that has been affecting transmissions these last few weeks
is finally over. It was in the suburbs of Brussels that a NATO
special task force discovered the pirate installation...
FRED (under his breath)
Discovered! Blew the place sky high more like!
VOICE-OFF SPEAKER
...Unfortunately the terrorists managed to make their getaway
before police arrived on the scene. It’s still not known how the
group operated, or on whose behalf. Meanwhile the federal
Government and the International Investigation Commission
are renewing their appeal to the public to report any suspicious
behaviour...
Fred picks up a packet of biscuits that he tears open as he walks
over to a telephone booth. He lifts the receiver and slips a card into
the machine. Checking no one is listening he digits a number.
FRED
Hello? Associated Pictures and Press? I need to speak to Neil
Baster. Tell him its urgent...
Fred slips a biscuit under his jacket. The monkey reaches out to
grab it.

73

FRED
Hello, Neil, is that you? Thanks for the holiday tip buddy...
But it’s a bit too hot for my style.
NEIL (off )
Where are you, Fred? Give me a number?
FRED
Those assholes almost wasted us. But I managed to get him out
of there, and for now we’re in the clear.
NEIL
He’s with you? Where the hell are you?
OTHER VOICE-OFF (creepy)
Tell us your location Mr. Newman.
FRED
What is this? Who are you? Put Neil on, goddammit.
NEIL (off )
Hey Fred, I’m sorry. They got me locked down on this one.
We can’t let him go. So why don’t you be a good boy and tell
us where we can come and get you.
FRED
Forget it. You know I don’t do that dance. I’m a journalist not
a cop!
NEIL (off )
I don’t think you realize what you’re dealing with here. You are
in shit that is black-hole deep, my friend.

74

FRED
Listen I have pictures and I have Europe’s most wanted. If you
don’t print, well we’ll just have to let the bidding war commence.
NEIL (off )
You’re fucking crazy. You don’t know what’s at stake!
FRED
I told you I never ever devil with the deep blue C. Your choice.
Take it or lose it.
OTHER VOICE OFF (with cool menace)
We can have you arrested, Mr. Newman, you’re about to step
into a world of inconvenience.
FRED
Yeah, but right now all you can do is go fuck yourself.
Furious, he hangs up and walks out the door.

Service Station – Ext. – Night
Fred is about to cross back over the road when out of nowhere
appears a three-wheeler van stacked high with wooden crates. It
narrowly avoids running him over and he starts back when he sees
that it’s Axel who is driving. Axel, still groggy with sleep struggles
to keep his eyes open, as the van zigzags and crashes into a trash
can, stalling the engine. Fred leaps on board, pushes Axel into the
back, and takes the wheel.

Main Road – Ext. – Night
The three-wheeler traverses housing estates, clutches of low buildings that seem to have sprouted up on the desolate terrain vague

75

of the city’s edgelands. Irritated by the tomato crates, Axel begins
jettisoning them onto the road.
FRED
Stop doing that, are you crazy, you’re going to give us away!
AXEL
Give away. Huh. Huh. And what did that asshole want. Hey,
I’m talking to you. What do you want from me?
FRED
Trust me; okay?
AXEL
That’s cute. He knocks me unconscious and it’s supposed to
inspire my trust.
FRED
Would you prefer I handed you over to the feds? It won’t take
a minute.
AXEL
Whatever, hombre. It’s your call. Just find me some shoes …
my feet are cold.

Hypermarket – Int. – Night
The customers, mostly couples, glide up and down the aisles to the
muffled strains of muzak.
Behind one of the rows of shelves we discover Axel seated on a stool.
Crouching awkwardly, Fred helps him try on a pair of training shoes.
Axel, making no effort to help Fred, studies him with a mocking air.

76

FRED
Not too tight? Stand up, see how it feels.
Axel gets up and wiggles his feet inside the shoes.
AXEL
They’re a bit on the clown side.
FRED
They’ll have to do, we’ve no time to lose.
He picks up the box, tucks it under his arm and makes for the
checkout.
Realising that Axel isn’t there, he turns round and sees him some
way back, shuffling forward like an ancient Chinese lackey, his
oversized training shoes still laced together.

Frankfurt – Ext. – Night
The three-wheeler crosses the city centre where the streets and
houses have been rebuilt in the same style as before the WWII
allied bombardments.
At a crossroads traffic light, Axel starts to bark loudly at the monkey.
Panicked, it tries to bite him. Fred manages to separate them.
The lights turn green. The three-wheeler stalls.
Exasperated honks from the cars stuck behind, unable to overtake.
Fred tries the ignition several times but to no avail.
FRED
Out, move.

77

He grabs Axel by the sleeve. They slip out of the vehicle and down
a side road, leaving the traffic blocked at the junction.
AXEL
Where are we going?
FRED
A friend’s place, where we can lay low.
They come to an enormous square dominated by electronic billboards. Several police cars are clustered around one of the buildings,
blue lights flashing.
FRED
About-face, quick...

Club – Int. – Night
A cacophony of noises floods the disco bar, a melange of dance music,
video game sounds and rowdy conversation.
The place is populated by an odd, multi-ethnic clientele, a mix of
jobless youth, drug addicts and other marginals, many of whom are
turned towards the DJ, Janice, a superb young punk, who visibly
rules the place. A guy approaches her, seizes her from behind. She
pushes him away.
GUY
What is it with you?
Janice shrugs her shoulders with a knowing sigh. Then, spotting a
young guy, Helmut, she smiles at him and signals him to join her.
Helmut gets up and forces his way through the crowd towards her.
She grabs him by the collar and kisses him, flashing a defiant look
at some other would-be suitors, before changing the record and

78

dragging him onto the dance floor. She dances with flair while he
struggles to imitate her moves.
JANICE
What are you doing after?
HELMUT
After what?
The rejected suitor goes back to his table.
GUY
That bitch!
His remark is greeted by titters of laughter. Then something happens
to change his aggressive demeanour.
GUY
Who’s that just walked in?
Axel has just appeared in the doorway.
OTHER GUY
Never seen him.
Behind Axel, Fred hesitates to enter the bar.
FRED
Careful, I don’t think this is our kind of place...
Axel rolls his eyes and crosses the room to the bar where he plucks
a boiled egg from a bowl. He starts to unpeel it and nonchalantly
ambles over to a pinball machine.

79

Looking extremely uncomfortable, Fred tries his best to fade into
the background. He takes a seat at a corner table.
Axel swallows the remains of the egg in one gulp and signals to
Fred that he needs change to play. Fred reluctantly gets up.
FRED
You could move your own derriere. I’m not your personal
assistant.
He gives him a few coins and takes an uneasy look around the room.
FRED
I don’t intend to hang around here long. This place is unhealthy.
AXEL
Hey, feel free. This isn’t a cop show. I don’t need you to have
my back.
He starts to play. Fred goes on staring at him silently.
AXEL
What are you looking at, are you a nance or what?
Looking vaguely ashamed, Fred steps back and bumps into Janice.
JANICE
Piss off grandad.
(To Axel ) Do you mind?
Without waiting for an answer, she pries his hands from the
pinball machine and takes his place.

80

Still on the dance floor, Helmut observes the scene. He looks
slightly peeved.
Janice plays with great dexterity.
AXEL
700,000 ... 800,000 ... 2,000,000! This chick is amazing!
As though to underline his enthusiasm, he executes a dangerous
backflip. Janice, nonplussed, stops playing.
The whole room is now looking at them.
FRED (to Axel )
Come on, show’s over. We’re out of here.
AXEL
What are you talking about? This is the shit, man! The girl has
definitely got game.
He inserts another coin in the machine. Janice thanks him with a
wink and beckons him to join her.
JANICE
Where you from? Not from around these parts, that’s for sure...
AXEL
Not exactly, I’m Belgian.
Enraged, Fred gives the pinball machine a hefty kick. Everything stops.

81

JANICE
Who invited this freak?
Fred seizes Axel firmly by the arm and drags him outside.
AXEL
Hey, that hurts.
Janice slides between the tables to rejoin Helmut. She whispers
something in his ear. He tries to embrace her but she slips away.
JANICE
Be nice and take over, will you... Do it, please, for me...

Club – Ext. – Night
Fred tries to force Axel away from the club.
FRED
Fucking moron!
AXEL
You need to take a chill pill padre.
FRED
You are really whacked. These bars are crawling with feds.
That girl...
AXEL
Her? No way.

82

JANICE
Hey guys! Where’s the party?
She dons a jacket and runs to catch up with them.
AXEL (grabbing her by her jacket collar)
I thought it was at your place.
(He casts a glance in Fred’s direction) We have a small problem,
you feel me?
JANICE (with a complicit air)
I feel you.
A taxi appears. Janice flags it down. They get in. Not wanting to
be left behind, Fred reluctantly follows.

Taxi – Int. – Night
JANICE (to the driver)
24, Oberstrasse.
DRIVER
Where’s that?
JANICE
North Ringsturmen.
DRIVER
I’m not going there.

83

JANICE
Move it, don’t be a pain.
The driver says nothing, just drives. Janice and Axel strike up
a conversation.
JANICE
Belgian you say?
AXEL
Yeah, from Brussels.
JANICE
They say things are kicking off up there.
Fred gives Axel a swift and violent kick.
JANICE
And what do you do?
AXEL
What do you mean do?
JANICE
I mean in life.
AXEL
Nothing much. Aside from a bit of biochemistry. And you?
JANICE
Well, you saw me.

84

AXEL
Ok, but what are you … a student?
Janice
Yeah like philopsychosocio lalalology, that kind of shit. Eugh,
what’s that monstrosity?
She indicates the monkey that has just defecated on the seat.
JANICE (to Fred )
Do you mind wiping your brat’s ass?
DRIVER
Hey, what’s that godawful stink back there?
Fred takes a Kleenex and wipes up the mess.
Janice whispers something in Axel’s ear, who responds likewise.
She bursts into a fit of giggles.
FRED (to Axel )
Would you cut it out!
JANICE
Oh so now he’s not allowed to talk to strange girls, ladies of
the night. What are you gonna do? Send him to bed without
any supper?
She grabs Axel by the neck and kisses him full on the mouth. We see
the car streak down an empty road and disappear into darkness.

85

Street off the Ringsturmen – Ext. – Night
A wheel sinks into a hole in the road’s broken surface. The taxi stops.
DRIVER
This is as far as I go.
He flicks the switch to release the centralised door locks. Janice gets
out, followed by Axel.
FRED
Hey, wait for me!
The driver turns round, brandishing a sawn-off shotgun. Fred
quickly gets out his wallet and offers him a banknote. Still gripping his weapon in two hands, the driver signals with his chin to
put the money on the front seat.
DRIVER
Put it there! There! Keep your hands where I can see them!
FRED
Easy!
DRIVER
I told you, I told you I’d had it with the Ringsturmen! You
know what the Ringsturmen is? A bunch of whores, crackheads, monkeys, Jews, ragheads is what the Rignsturmen is.
Fred gathers up the monkey, slips it under his jacket and gets out
of the taxi.
FRED
Yeah well, so long!
The driver puts down his gun.

86

DRIVER
Goodnight sir. Thanks anyway.
(He points up the road ) Oh, no. No. 24’s up that way.
FRED
Sorry?
DRIVER
Over there … see?
The wheel revs before coming unstuck from the hole, causing
the taxi to skid violently as it reverses. The driver swings the car
around and out of sight.
A desolate wasteland of crumbling factory buildings. The area
seems completely deserted.
Distant metallic rumbling contributes to a vaguely menacing
atmosphere. Following the taxi-driver’s indications, Fred walks up
the road. We hear the soles of his boots crackling the gravel.
At number 24, he pushes open a rusty iron grille and enters a
courtyard piled up with old barrels, crates and metal girders...
The courtyard is bordered on three sides by semi-dilapidated
hangars that Fred proceeds to explore with a torch. In the one
at the furthest end he spies a metal staircase which he mounts,
moving stealthily. Through a skylight on the first floor he sees there
is another building hidden behind the hangar: sheets are hung out
to dry on a terrace.
Fred redescends, looking for an entryway. He hears someone cursing.
In the beam of his lamp appears the ravaged face of a drunken
tramp, lying amid piles of empty cans and bottles.

87

FRED
Sorry!
The man mutters incomprehensibly.
FRED
How do you get to the other side?
The drunk picks up a bottle and flings it in his direction. The
bottle narrowly misses Fred and smashes against the wall.
A short while later, Fred comes upon a passageway leading to another courtyard, completely different from the first, with flowerpots,
a portico and a swing. Everything here is clean and well-ordered.
He is standing in front of a well-kept industrial building whose only
ground-floor door is locked. The windows are not too high, however,
and Fred is able to hoist himself up onto a window ledge. With
an effort he slides open a glass pane and hauls himself inside...

Factory – Int. – Night
A child’s cry resounds through the building. The monkey escapes,
bounding through the room. A door opens and the light goes on.
Janice appears.
JANICE(to a little girl )
Don’t be afraid, there’s nothing to be frightened of. He’s an
American.
MANOU
Do we know him?
JANICE
Yes, yes, we know him.

88

On one side of the immense space where they are standing is a
partitioned corner-room for the little girl, while on the other is a
hammock where a bearded forty-something man lies snoring.
ROBERT
Turn that bloody light off!
JANICE (to Fred )
Try to make less noise. Here, this way.
FRED
Is Axel there?
JANICE
Oh yes, your scoop is here. Don’t worry!
FRED (shocked )
What did he tell you?
JANICE
Tell me? Of course he tells me things, it’s natural, don’t you think.
Now that we know each other, now that we’re going steady!
Fred, agitated, looks around. He makes a lunge at the monkey but
it’s too quick for him.
All three leave the room, passing to an adjacent space.

Janice’s Space – Int. – Night
Smaller than the one preceding it, the room Janice occupies resembles a library or study, the walls are lined from floor to ceiling with
bookshelves. In one corner is a large bed, in another a freestanding
bathtub where Axel is busy taking a shower.

89

AXEL (to Fred )
There you are! Where were you? We were looking for you
everywhere.
FRED
Twat!
Axel laughs.
The little girl pours some milk in a bowl for the monkey.
FRED
No, no milk. Especially not milk!
MANOU
Why not, does it give her a tummy ache?
FRED (taking back the monkey)
Yeah, tummy ache.
(He goes up to Axel, looking determined ) Listen, there’s something
I have to tell you, I don’t think you understand the situation.
Axel turns the showerhead on him, the jet of water hits him square
in the face. Too enraged to care, the American whacks him on the
back. Axel leaps out of the tub, howling in pain.
AXEL
Help! Janice, help!
Janice can’t stop herself from laughing. Fred, embarrassed, recovers
his poise. He takes off his soaked jacket and lets it fall to the ground.
FRED
Everybody just calm down, and you stop being a jackass.

90

Axel executes a somersault, landing in the bed sheets.
Fred, stunned, drops into an armchair. Manou picks up the jacket
and places it delicately over a chair.
AXEL (to Janice)
You coming?
Janice looks at Fred, somewhat embarrassed by the journalist’s
presence.
(to Fred )
Listen padre, we’ll talk about it tomorrow ok?
MANOU (to Fred )
Leave them alone, come with me.
Fred, with some reluctance, gets up and approaches the bed, just as
Axel lifts the sheet and begins to furiously pedal his feet in the air,
as though trying to ward off the blows of an adversary.
FRED
Watch out. Can’t say I really give a shit, but if you go on acting
like a jerk you’re going to get burned.
He leaves, led by Manou who carries his jacket.

Factory – Int. – Night
We follow them down a long corridor opening onto a large room
fitted out like a kitchen. Fred looks around, worried.
FRED
What’s this?

91

MANOU
The kitchen stupid!
FRED
Whose kitchen?
MANOU
Everyone’s.
FRED
Who’s everyone? You mean it’s like a commune?
MANOU
Well yes, actually no. It’s like whatever. Robert wants it to be a
commune but no one listens to him.
FRED
Who’s Robert? Your daddy?
MANOU
Oh no... I don’t have a daddy. I can do what I want.
They mount a metal staircase at the top of which is a trap door.
Fred helps Manou lift it to reveal a large room where a young
elegantly dressed black guy, Steve, is fiddling with a game console.
He acknowledges Fred with a nod. Intrigued, the American does
likewise.
FRED (to Manou)
He live here too?

92

MANOU
He works here but he doesn’t sleep. It’s Jennifer who brought
him.
The room opens onto the terrace where sheets are drying, at the end
of which is a laundry room...

Laundry Room – Int. – Night
Amid laundry baskets, boxes of washing powder and several large
washing machines, we see a man laid out on a double mattress,
his eyes wide open staring into space. Suddenly he shoots straight
up, his back rigid as though he had only a single articulation at
the hips.
ERIC (pointing at Fred )
Who is he?
MANOU
He’s an American. We know him, he’s got a monkey!
With the same movement he lies back down. Pointing a finger,
Manou indicates the empty space next to Eric.
MANOU (to Fred )
You just have to lie down there.
She goes to look for a blanket in the laundry basket. Fred remains
frozen to the spot as if in a daze, his arms dangling.
MANOU
Do I have to make your bed for you as well?

93

FRED
No, it’s okay.
She leaves. Fred, resigned, takes his place on the mattress.
ERIC
Move over.
FRED
What?
ERIC
On that side. You’re disturbing Francis and Dominique.
FRED
What? Where?
Fred, taken aback, shifts his body to leave a wide-open space
between himself and Eric.
Lying back down, Eric stretches out his arm to activate a washing
machine jammed up against the mattress. The metallic buckling
and rattling seem to give him great waves of pleasure.

Janice’s Space – Int. – Night
Axel, who is naked, lies on the bed with Janice, chatting.
JANICE
So you were in on this stunt from the beginning?
AXEL
Are you kidding! It was me who started this stunt, as you put it.

94

JANICE
But why did you want to fuck up the TV, the telephones, satellites?
AXEL
I didn’t want anything. Besides what happens with communications isn’t so important.
JANICE
What is?
AXEL
It’s... I don’t know, it’s hard to say. You see it’s this thing that
can unleash an amazing force...
We see that Manou has come back into the room.
MANOU
Is it the Russians?
JANICE
It’s none of your concern. Come on, back to bed!
Manou goes over to kiss them both goodnight.
MANOU
G’night Janice. G’night Mister!
She grabs hold of Axel’s ears to get a closer look at his face.
AXEL
Ow! That hurts!

95

MANOU
All right. I’m going.
As soon as she’s out the door, Axel leaps on top of Janice and begins
caressing her frenetically. Janice undresses.
JANICE
But what is it exactly?
AXEL
Exactly what?
JANICE
This force!
He lets her go.
AXEL
It’s like a cosmic energy... I mean, not exactly cosmic...
Excited, Janice straddles him.
Gradually, in a long cross-dissolve, an intermittent flicker of
micro-cellular organisms begins to appear, superimposed on the
scene of Axel and Janice making love. These fluorescent pulsings
are of variable frequency and duration: three brief pulses followed
by two longer ones, then five shorter ones, then nothing before the
whole sequence repeats itself.

Chronobiology Lab – Int. – Day
Now completely visible, we see that the pulsings are being
observed by Axel through an electron microscope. With his
shoulders hunched over the apparatus, Axel is dressed in a white

96

labcoat whose whiteness is made more dazzling by the neon
striplights overhead.
The microscope is connected to an oscilloscope. An automated
pen traces the rhythms of the waveforms on a roll of paper that
cascades to the floor and mounts in a concertinaed pile. The microorganisms seem to be emitting a form of morse code, an impression
accentuated by Axel rhythmically tapping his fingers on the table
as he watches.
Suddenly the door opens, causing a window to fly open violently.
The wind tunnel lifts the length of paper from the floor, waving it
like a pennant in the face of the new arrival, a guy in his thirties
who is the director of the laboratory. Indifferent to the disturbances,
Axel turns hastily towards him.
AXEL
We’ve got it … take a look! I’ve found this regular micro-rhythm
the chloroplasts are emitting. This is incredible. This is like
fucking Nobel-Prize incredible. The discovery of the century!
A language! I mean … something like a language, that comes
from the very depths of cellular life!
The director smiles, brushing away the printout with the back of
his hand.
DIRECTOR
Can I ask our Nobel-in-waiting to shut the window?
Axel complies.
AXEL
Don’t you see? The chloroplasts of this mutant strain of phytoplankton are sending out messages. Wouldn’t you agree?

97

DIRECTOR (with a hint of irony)
Of a sort. Hope you’re writing it all down, their message to
the world.
AXEL
Listen, this is serious. Anyway I’ve got an idea and you’re going
to help me. I want to expose the strain to the same series of light
pulses and see if they respond and then if the response changes.
The puzzled face of the director.
AXEL
What’s with you? Don’t you think it’s good manners to respond
when something speaks to you?

Janice’s Space – Int. – Night
JANICE
And so?
AXEL
And so what?
JANICE
And so what happened then? Tell me everything or I’ll shop
you to the feds!
Janice traps Axel in a headlock but he soon slips free. He jumps
to a standing position, runs up against a wall and scales it to an
impressive height before doing a back-flip and landing again on
his feet.
AXEL (as he lands)
You have to catch me first. Okay, the director was a bit of an

98

asshole, but he was cool about it at least. He let me go on with
the experiment. The problem was it didn’t work so they fired me.
JANICE
No shit!
AXEL
In a way it was because I’d already decided to continue on my
own. I realised I’d screwed up somehwere, that it didn’t work
with light waves, so I’d have to try something else. So I started
again, this time using hertzian sound waves, I set up a small lab
in the suburbs of Brussels, and that’s when it started working.
JANICE
Sick! Hertzian waves. Frequency modulated?
AXEL
Natürlich.
JANICE
And did it get back to you?
AXEL
Not so fast... At first there was no clear response. But then I
discovered that the chloroplasts of the phytoplankton were just
a relay, it was a whole other deal.
JANICE
Wait a sec, chloroplasts, sorry to be remedial but what are they
again?
AXEL
The seat of photosynthesis.

99

JANICE
Right! But what’s it relaying?
AXEL
Ah if you only knew!
He jumps again and grabs hold of the doorframe, swinging back and
forth by his fingertips. Janice stubs out her cigarette and embraces
him, lifting herself off the ground. They begin to swing together.
AXEL
We’re always wondering whether there might be life or intelligence on other planets, way up in the stars ... but we never
ask ourselves about the infinitely small ... maybe it could come
from there, from a universe that’s even smaller than protons,
electrons, quarks...
Janice bites Axel, making him let go.
JANICE
Great! Wonderful! But now the whole thingʼs fucked. Those
government assholes had to ruin it! For once they had something really interesting in their laps and they screwed it up. Just
because it was disturbing their crappy TV and radio schedules.
What harm could it do to them? It was actually pretty good;
made a change from the usual bullshit. If they didn’t like it
they could always go fuck themselves.
AXEL (scratching his thigh)
Yeah but they found it was interfering with communications,
radar, laser guidance systems...
JANICE
You know what I say? Fuck them, that’s what I say. Let them
choke on their cornflakes. Retire to a padded cell. Buy a ticket

100

to euthanasia. Just as long as they leave us the fuck alone... If we
don’t even have the right to communicate with another universe!
Standing on his head, Axel begins to fall asleep. Janice shakes him.
She points at the pendant that has fallen across his face.
JANICE
What’s that? A school medal?
AXEL
No, don’t touch.
Janice lunges, tries to take it off him. The chain breaks.
AXEL
What the bitch!
She opens the locket. It contains a phial, which she holds in the
palm of her hand.
JANICE
Is this the strain of phytoplankton you were on about?
Axel nods.
JANICE
So we could reestablish contact with ... with...

Communal Kitchen – Int. – Day
A small group is huddled around the table. Robert, who feigns
indifference towards what’s going on, picks absentmindedly on a
guitar and forces a wheezing two-note refrain from his harmonica.
With him are Steve and Janice.

101

Manou arrives to find them deep in conversation.
STEVE (to Janice)
You saying this shit is smaller than quarks. Okay, that’s cool. But
how you figure a little-bitty particle smaller than a quark is gonna start blowing radio waves out its ass? That shit is too weird.
JANICE
Why don’t you ask him yourself?
(To Manou) Where’s Axel?
MANOU
I know where he is. I’ll go and fetch him!
She leaves.
JANICE
Robert, would you mind not playing that guitar in lieu of me
garrotting you with the D string?
ROBERT
Why shouldn’t I play? Man’s got a right to sing the blues, no?
JANICE
Forget the blues, this is serious business!
ROBERT
Well you know what, I think it’s serious bullshit. All these
stories, I smell a rat, I smell a fucking plague of rats. For a start
there’s your boyfriend, what about his buddy?
JANICE
He’s not his buddy, he’s an American journalist...

102

ROBERT
Journalist, cop, what’s the differential? And then this quark
business, we have to see...
STEVE (forestalling Robert)
You know what, wise old man of the mountain, I think you’re
right. What the fuck can a quark have to say to the comrades
in the pen?
Everyone laughs except Robert, who doesn’t appreciate the joke.
ROBERT
Okay, do what you want! But I think I have the right to speak,
I mean I don’t want to come off like some bastard landlord, but
it was me who squatted this place, and it’s me who has to fix
everything. So we should at least discuss it!
Axel arrives carrying Manou piggyback.
ROBERT (to Manou)
You get down from there!
MANOU
I thought it was forbidden to forbid?
ROBERT
That’s none of your business!
MANOU
You’re just jealous!
STEVE (to Axel )
Something I can’t figure out is how your Infra-quark Universe

103

can interfere with radio waves when, quantically speaking,
they’re from a whole other-ass dimension.
AXEL
Look, for the moment the idea of the Infra-quark Universe is
just a hypothesis. The only thing I’m sure of right now is that
the strain functions as some kind of relay.
Eric and Fred burst in. Eric carries the monkey on his shoulder.
Fred doesn’t look too good: unshaven and unkempt, he looks like
he’s had a rough night.
MANOU (to Steve, indicating Fred )
Do you think he’s a fairy?
STEVE
Hush child!
FRED (to Axel )
Axel, can you come here?
ROBERT
You don’t smell anything? There’s a strange odour about, don’t
you find... Reminds me a bit of a pigsty.
MANOU
Is he a fairy or a fed, a pig or a poke?
FRED (extremely irritated )
Of course I’m a fed, can’t you tell from the way I dress?
STEVE (aside to Axel )
So if I got this right, there must be some kind of subatomic
relay?

104

Axel takes a sheet of paper and a pencil and begins drawing.
AXEL
Yes, the way I figure it, it must be here. But then it’s even more
complicated because look...
FRED (to Axel )
I said I needed to talk to you!
AXEL
Fuck off. Can’t you see we’re working?
FRED
What are you up to?
AXEL
If you must know, we’ve decided to go on with the experiments.
Eric leans over the plan Axel has been drawing. He looks very
interested.
FRED
What experiments? Oh yeah, the global clusterfuck experiments.
Haven’t you had enough?
AXEL
What’s it to you?
ROBERT
Great, why don’t you just call a press conference? Perfect!
AXEL
Don’t worry. It’s cool. He’s going to wrap it up, aren’t you my

105

old poppet? Your scoop, wrap it up, roll it up and stick it up
your culo. Am I wrong? You’re finished, you know it, you’re
fucking toast!
Fred gives Axel the finger to let him know he has had enough of
this subject.
FRED
Is there nothing to drink in this rathole?
MANOU
I can make you some coffee. With milk?
FRED
I said drink!
Sound of mopeds from outside. Fred rushes over to the window.
FRED
Who’s that?
MANOU
Antoine and Michèle.

Factory – Ext. – Day
We see two teenagers on mopeds, panniers stuffed with schoolbooks
and ring binders. Slaloming to avoid the objects strewn in their
path they cross the two internal courtyards, then speed off down
the hillside road.

106

Factory – Int. – Day
Axel climbs the metal staircase, opens the trap door and enters
Steve’s attic space. He sets about clearing away the clutter.

Cooperative Hangar – Int. – Day
An immense hangar piled up with crates and boxes, some of
which lie half-opened, revealing contents that include computer
terminals, keyboards, video monitors, cables, tinned foods etc.
Mr. Kao Ky, impeccably dressed in an old-style tunic, sits on an
electric car that also serves as a mobile office, complete with desk
and computer.
Another Asian man, the frail and wan-complexioned Mr. Wang,
circulates on a forklift looking for materials that Kao Ky requests
by barking into a microphone. Janice and Steve stand closeby.
Janice studies a list while Steve checks the contents of a mounting
stack of crates.
JANICE
Fibre optic cable LM 20.342.
KAO KY
Kao Ky he has that.
(Speaking into the microphone) Hello, Mr. Wang, LM 20.342!
Kao Ky follows Wang’s movements on a video monitor.
KAO KY
No, not there. Farther. More to right, yes that way. Is good.
See Kao Ky has that stuff.
STEVE
And what about a pediascope? Quadrichrome. An old one will
do, even without software.

107

KAO KY
How you call? Quadrichrome pediascope. Yes Kao Ky has that
too. Hello Mr. Wang! Aeroflot pediascope. You find in reserve
zone. Next to tin food.
Suddenly Kao Ky notices the figure of Eric on his screen, scaling
the shelves.
KAO KY
What he doing you friend? No meddle with merchandise.
Janice leans in to take a look at the screen.
KAO KY
What he want up there. What he trying to do?
JANICE (speaking into the microphone)
Hey Eric? Get down from there, come back here!
Eric ignores her completely.
JANICE
Oh let him be, he’s harmless.
KAO KY
But is not stable. Is not stable you friend!
MR. WANG
Don’t find Aeroflot pediascope, Mr. Ky.
KAO KY
Kao Ky know well he has pediascope. Kao Ky, he find.

108

(To Janice, pointing at Eric) Tell you friend not to steal, that
stuff too expensive.
Kao Ky sets off. Steve steps onto the running board.
MR. WANG
It’s okay. Wang find pediascope.
Kao Ky slams on the brakes, almost throwing Steve off the vehicle.
KAO KY
You pay tension. You friend, where is he you friend?
STEVE
Hold up a sec! What we gonna do about the serial numbers
and registration?
KAO KY
No problem for serial numbers. Kao Ky he take care of that.
He calls Mr. Wang
KAO KY
Bring machine to make serial numbers. Yes you know well.
Regional Bureau...
STEVE
Hey. None of this gets out. Keep it in the ground, you feel me?
KAO KY
But yes of course. No problem. Never problem with Kao Ky.

109

Cooperative Hangar – Ext. – Day
Steve and Janice begin loading the crates into the back of the van,
while Eric, brandishing a retractable ruler like a sword, takes
meaningless measurements all around the vehicle. Kao Ky observes
them from his office window.

Street – Ext. – Day
The van is so weighed down that the chassis almost skims the
road. In the back, Eric is literally walled in by crates, his body
happily contorted.
On the sidewalk, we see a group of teenagers, among whom are
Antoine and Michèle.
Suddenly, Michèle alerts Antoine to a flyer she has spotted, freshly
plastered to the wall: a wanted notice offering a reward for the
capture of Axel and Fred.
MICHÈLE (to Antoine)
Look!
ANTOINE
40,000!
Approaching the flyer, they are suddenly accosted by a man in a
gabardine raincoat.
MAN
Interest you does it? Perhaps you know something about it.
MICHÈLE
No, I’m afraid ... but if we did you can be sure that...

110

Factory – Int. – Day
Fred inspects the building with its odd mix of furnished rooms and
ruined, abandoned spaces.
He pushes aside a heavy curtain and discovers a room decked out
in elegant bourgeois style complete with night tables, wall lamps
and matching rugs.
On one side is Antoine and Michèle’s desk, together with two tables
piled up with schoolbooks.
Continuing his explorations he arrives at an almost empty room,
beautiful in its Japanese-style minimalism.
FEMALE VOICE
Shoes!
Fred retreats to the doorway, takes off his shoes and then pads back
into the room. We see a young redhaired woman in her thirties,
Jennifer, kneeling before an engraving.
JENNIFER (with extreme concentration)
The kite
In the same place
As the sky yesterday
She ignores Fred as he crosses the room, exits through another door
and continues on until he reaches the kitchen.

Kitchen – Int. – Day
Manou, her sleeves rolled up to her elbows, slaps a large lump of
dough on the table. Startled by the noise, the monkey takes refuge
on top of the fridge.

111

MANOU
So who is it you like best?
FRED
Who what?
MANOU
Eric or Axel?
FRED (flustered )
It’s the same.
MANOU
So you’re jealous then?
FRED
Jealous? Of what?
MANOU
Of Axel making jing-jing with Janice?
Enraged, Fred grabs the ball of dough and raises his arm as though
to fling it in the little girl’s face. Engine sounds.
MANOU
They’re back!
She wipes her hands on her sweatshirt and skips out the door.
The camera follows.

Factory – Ext. – Day
Manou goes to open the rear doors of the van. Eric’s body is
“stacked” among the crates. Steve sounds the car horn. Axel
arrives on the scene. Robert pokes his head out the window.

112

ROBERT
Quiet, I’m trying to compose!
Jennifer appears at another window.
JENNIFER
Robert. Stop yelling.
AXEL (to Janice)
Did you get everything?
JANICE
Pretty much. The essentials anyway.
Axel grabs her by the neck to kiss her. She pushes him away and
turns to pick up a crate.
STEVE (to Axel )
That’s the way she is, just gotta groove with it. You gonna give
me a hand unloading this shit?
With a resigned sigh, Axel picks up a crate and carries it to Steve’s
space. Fred appears at the foot of the stairs.
FRED (to Axel )
Wait, let me help you with that.
AXEL
What’s with you? Miss your deadline?
FRED
Something like that. So anyway, what have I got to lose?

113

AXEL
Sure, here, take it from this end.
Fred passes his monkey to Eric who cradles it in his arms like a
baby. Up in the “laboratory,” Axel sets down the crate and gives
instructions how to install the various devices. A febrile atmosphere
takes hold as he grabs a piece of chalk and draws the assembly
diagram on the wall.
AXEL
The sequences will be coded with this device.
FRED
What do you mean by sequences?
AXEL
Oh it’s just a phase really, it doesn’t necessarily mean anything
on its own. But then the coded sequences are transmitted by
this machine here in the form of hertzian waves.
FRED
The same setup you had in Belgium?
JANICE (aggressively)
Oh so you’re interested now?
STEVE
What’s going on? You planning on continuing with that
reportage of yours?
FRED (with a shrug)
No … but maybe one day I’ll write a book about all this.

114

MANOU (to Axel )
Yes, but in Brussels you got caught and they blew everything
up and if Fred hadn’t arrived you would have been blown to
little pieces and they’d have to scrape you off the walls.
JANICE (calling Axel to account)
So you’re sure we won’t be discovered. Cause even if the radio
wave disturbances start again, with that thing there (she
indicates a half-opened mini-radar dish) they won’t be able to
figure out our position.
Robert’s head appears through the trap door. He carries a huge
basket of laundry under one arm. He begins to ferret around in
the room.
ROBERT
How’s it going with your UIQ?
MANOU
You say “You I Cue!”
ROBERT
You I who?
Fred writes it in chalk on the wall.
FRED
You I Cue. Universe of the Infra-Quark.
ROBERT
What the fuck is he still doing here?
FRED
Bother you some?

115

ROBERT
Yeah, as a matter of fact. This is my place!
Eric steps between them, bearing his teeth at Robert like the monkey.
ROBERT (disconcerted )
Calm down, Eric, it’s okay!
Michèle and Antoine appear, both carrying ring binders.
MICHÈLE
What’s going on here?
Antoine elbows her, having immediately recognized Axel and
Fred. Michèle too recognizes the wanted men. Excited, and with a
conspiratorial air, they signal to Robert who takes no notice.
MANOU (to Robert)
Haven’t you got something better to do, like the laundry?
ROBERT (leaving the room)
Cheeky little shit! I’m telling you it’ll end in tears.
Michèle and Antoine follow him out of the room.

Factory Terrace – Ext. – Day
Antoine unfolds the poster he has ripped from the wall .
ANTOINE
You see that? (he points at the two photos of Axel and Fred )
And that? (he indicates the reward ) 40,000 is no small change!

116

ROBERT
You see this, you little fuckwit!
He slaps him around the head.
ROBERT
Do I make myself clear?
ANTOINE (pitifully)
Hey, take it easy, Robert. I was just kidding.

Lab – Int. – Night
All the connections have been made, numerous cables snake across
the floor.
AXEL (to Janice)
Ok, it’s all yours.
Fred, Manou, Steve and Jennifer turn towards her as she takes
out the phial she removed from Axel’s pendant, breaks it open and
pours the solution onto a glass slide. There is a general holding of
breath as she carefully covers it with another slide and then slips it
under the lens of the electron microscope, which is connected to a
screen. Axel switches it on and we see a high definition image of the
cellular organisms pulsing with an irregular glow.
JANICE
What’s going on? You think it’s normal for it to be flashing so
randomly?
AXEL
Yes, I think so.

117

He adjusts the image on the electronic oscilloscope where we see a
horizontal line tracing out the pulse variations. Steve is sitting in
front of the sequence generator: a keyboard that triggers hertzian
waves, which it sends over to the phytoplankton sample.
STEVE
Let’s party.
AXEL
Ok... Go!
Steve taps out a “phrase,” similar to a message in Morse code.
No apparent change is noted on the electronic oscilloscope.
MANOU
What’s he up to Mr. UIQ? Is he sleeping? Why doesn’t he answer?
JANICE
Maybe he’s gone for a stroll in another galaxy.
MANOU
No, no … it’s not like that, he has to come back!
Try again, Steve!
Steve tries again with another sequence and then several more but
there is still no response. Everyone becomes despondent.
JENNIFER
It doesn’t look like it wants to answer...
STEVE
I’m smoked. I’m gonna catch some Z’s.

118

MANOU
Move over, out of the way. Let me do it!
She lunges at the table and trips over a cable causing the sequence
generator to fall.
STEVE (furious)
Manou, beat it!
MANOU
I’m sick of this. It’s not my fault if your stupid machine doesn’t
work.
JANICE
To bed, now!
She opens the trap door and ushers Manou out.
Axel gathers up the machine, takes off the hood and examines
the damage.
AXEL
It’s nothing.
(To Steve) You got any microwelding gear around here?
Steve rummages in a crate and hands him a welding gun.
STEVE
This do?
AXEL
Perfect.

119

JANICE
You gonna do that now?
AXEL
Why not?
JANICE
Well, I have to go, I’m late.
STEVE
I’ll come with you. I have to take back Doom Nation V.
He indicates a discarded console game in the corner.
AXEL (to Janice)
You ditching me girl? Say it isn’t so.
JANICE (laughing)
Yeah, you’re a fucking drag.
Steve moves away, Janice grabs him by the arm. Axel watches as
they leave together.

Steve’s Car – Ext. / Int. – Night
The car zips down several streets. Janice and Steve are talking.
Both look worried.
JANICE
What do you think? Is it going to work?
STEVE
I don’t know jack shit. What about you?

120

JANICE
Well there’s no reason...
STEVE
But I can see this turning into a situation.
JANICE
Meaning?
STEVE
A warrant for Axel and Fred.
JANICE
Come off it. They dish out more warrants than parking tickets.
The car parks in front of the video store and Steve pops his game
into the returns box.

Laundry – Int. – Night
Fred, his monkey and Eric are asleep. Suddenly Eric jackknifes up,
his back stiff as a board, and sets the washing machine in motion.
Fred awakens with a violent start.
FRED
Hey! Turn that machine off.
ERIC
What machine?
FRED
The wa-shing-ma-chine! That thing, there!

121

ERIC
Impossible.
FRED
Why impossible? Just press the stop button.
ERIC
Impossible because if I stop it the Earth stops. And secondly,
if it starts up again, it’s going to turn in the opposite direction.
In which case we will be in a well of woe and lamentation.
Thirdly, it’s none of your fucking business. Fourthly, Francis
and Dominique wouldn’t like it. And fifthly, because it does
something to me...
FRED
And what might that be?
Eric gives him the finger, Fred shrugs his shoulders.
ERIC (politely)
You’ll just have to get used to it.
FRED
Fine!
He wraps himself in a blanket and goes out onto the terrace.

Terrace – Ext. – Night
The moon illumines the factory and surrounding buildings, bathing them in an air of mystery. Fred lights a cigarette, his shadow
plays across the hanging sheets. Hearing noises coming from the
laboratory, he goes over to the door to see what’s going on.

122

Lab – Int. – Night
Now alone in the lab room, Axel taps out sequences on the repaired
generator. After a short delay, the sequence is approximately reproduced on the oscilloscope.
FRED
It’s working.
AXEL
Yes, I think it’s responding. I’m going to get Janice. You take over.
FRED (intimidated )
No, I don’t think I’m able.
AXEL
Don’t be stupid, try...
As Fred sits down at the console, Axel picks up a telephone directory.
Before he has time to consult it, the phone rings. He picks up.
AXEL
Hello ... what? Who is this?

Robert and Manou’s Space – Int. – Night
Little Manou holds the receiver.
MANOU
Iʼm telling you … thereʼs something in the TV.
Robert bangs on the TV set, the image is all disrupted.

123

MANOU (to Robert)
Stop, you’re going to break it...
MANOU (to Axel )
Axel, you have to come, heʼs going to break the TV!
The sound comes back, an Eastern European sports commentary.
Then the war film they had been watching comes back on with an
unrelated sound now accompanying the images.
Suddenly, in a kind of media cataclysm, we see a rapid
succession of random images from channels all over the world,
frequently superimposed and with the sounds all jumbled up
in a grotesque cacophony.
ROBERT
If I’m not wrong, it’s starting again, isn’t it?

Lab – Int. – Night
Fred, Robert, Manou, Michèle and Antoine are gathered around
Axel who operates the signal transmitter. They all notice, with
varying degrees of interest, that something finally appears to be
happening. Janice storms in with Steve.
JANICE
So it is true, it responds!
AXEL
Look...
Axel taps out a sequence for the bacteria sample. After a long
moment of silence, blobs of fluorescent light begin to rearrange
themselves on the main screen of the electronic microscope.

124

The oscilloscope shows a succession of peaks and flat lines corresponding to the short sounds emitted by Axel.
JANICE
Can I try?
AXEL
Sure, go ahead!
Janice taps a slightly more elaborate sequence. UIQ tries to
reproduce it, fails, tries again but can’t manage.
MANOU (speaking towards the sample)
No, that’s not it, pay attention ... it’s not like that!
Janice plays the same sequence again.
After a moment’s hesitation, UIQ manages to reproduce the
message correctly. Everyone seems fascinated, except Robert who
remains studiously indifferent.
ROBERT
Very clever, but your wotsitsname is still fucking up the TV!
A man can’t even watch a film in peace...
AXEL
I think it’s when he doesn’t get it straight away that he loses the
plot. But it doesn’t matter, it’s just a phase.
JENNIFER
Maybe, but it scares people, you know...
AXEL
Who cares? I’m telling you, it’s just a phase, we’ll sort it out.

125

We just have to wait until weʼve fixed things ... so they can’t
trace us.
ANTOINE (looking scornfully at them all, somewhat pompous)
Who cares? Who cares? Perhaps we ought to discuss it. So
this is your idea of fun, is it? Screwing up emergency services,
satellite links?
MICHÈLE (haughty)
Oh, let them play with their toys!
JANICE
Shut up you two. I can’t hear anything.
She plays a simple sequence which UIQ repeats. Slowly at first,
and then more and more frenetically.
MANOU (to UIQ)
Good, that’s very good!
Manou pushes Janice aside.
MANOU
Now itʼs my turn. Itʼs my turn!
She taps out an extremely complicated sequence, which UIQ tries
and fails to copy.
AXEL
Thatʼs too difficult.
MANOU
Okay, let me try something else...

126

She taps out another sequence which she hums along to. UIQ tries
to repeat it. She plays another long sequence, which UIQ gets in
a muddle.

Taxi – Ext./Int. – Night
A driver sits at the wheel of his car, parked in a taxi rank.
A familiar signal tells him he has a call. He lifts the receiver.
Off-screen we hear a loud and brutal cacophony of voices.
The driver jumps back with a start.
DRIVER
This is the Taxi!
The noise becomes unbearable.
Lights go on suddenly, windows open.
Terrified, the driver gets out and runs away.

Lab – Int. – Night
On the oscilloscope the waveform’s peaks and troughs become
extremely chaotic, breaking into dots, lines and stochastic patterns.
Michèle and Antoine are no longer present.
JANICE
Manou, you can’t just do any old thing with that.
ROBERT
When are you lot going to stop with your psychotic squiggling?
Appalled, the others turn towards him.

127

ROBERT (lowering his tone)
I mean can’t I just see my bloody programme!
Axel contemplates the screen.
AXEL
Let her do it, watch!
Eric begins to dance making odd, jerky movements.
JENNIFER
It’s incomprehensible... But I ask myself if UIQ might
not have some kind of rapport with what the Hindus call
bhaktevadanta swami prabhypaba?
STEVE (ironically)
Ah yes, the famous nectar of the gods. You are surely right
sister. I don’t see any other possible explanation.
Suddenly, on a larger screen, geodesic measurements appear,
together with a moving dot.
JANICE
Manou, I forbid you to type in whatever you feel like. That
machine is not for kids.
MANOU
He can’t repeat things, but it’s cute what he does, don’t you think?
Eric dances with increasing savagery, throwing himself against
Robert, headbutting him in the chest.
ROBERT
You’re all fucking crazy. He was never this bad. I’m telling

128

you, we should throw all this shit out, get rid of it. It must be
something cooked up by the Americans, or the Russians ...
it could be some kind of biological weapon for all we know!
The screen flashes on again with its geodesic measurements. Then,
suddenly, we see a pair of hands approaching...

Control Tower – Int. – Day
...the hands of an air-traffic controller.
In the room the atmosphere is tense.
With an index finger, the controller follows the trajectory of the
moving dot.
CONTROLLER
He’s ignoring all instructions, what the hell is he doing ... with
300 passengers aboard!
SECOND CONTROLLER
Resume contact immediately. Emergency Program 1.

Boeing – Int. – day
The anguished face of a male passenger, one hand over his rapidly
pumping heart.

Control Tower – Int. – day
The controller switches on a microphone.
CONTROLLER
This is control. Order to correct your flight path immediately.

129

Do you hear me? Correct your flight path, for chrissakes.
Immediate correction. Emergency. Get back up in the air...

Boeing – Int. – Day
The same worried passenger unbuckles his seatbelt and gets down on
all fours in the gangway. Tossed by the jolting plane, he appears to be
trying to retrieve a fallen pen. The pen rolls under the feet of a woman passenger. The guy crawls over to her and leaps at her throat.
MALE PASSENGER
My pen, give me back my pen, bitch!
The woman smashes him on the head. He crumples to the ground,
stunned by the blow.
We see the legs of the hostess passing rapidly down the corridor until
she reaches the cockpit. She is hardly in the door when the pilot
and co-pilot turn towards her, looking dismayed. Confused, she
examines her uniform.
VOICE-OFF
This is Control...
A cacophony of voices gradually resolves into a mass bleating of goats.

Beach – Ext. – Day
On the beach of a Club Med are numerous sunbathers, many with
transistor radios. A small boy plays with a paper airplane, making
engine sounds with his mouth.
Overhead, an ultralight aircraft appears. The pilot waves to the
boy who launches his plane in the man’s direction...

130

Suddenly, we hear a terrifying screaming noise as the upside down
Boeing appears out of nowhere, skimming the ground, its tail
drawing a line in the sand. It passes just beneath the ultralight,
thrusting it up into the sky at great speed...
The wind from the plane’s jetstream sweeps everything away from
the beach: sun umbrellas, beach cabins, trees, everything is turned
upside down.
People are buried up to their necks in sand.
BOY
Mummy, where’s my plane?
MOTHER
Hey, let’s just see if we can find daddy first, then we’ll look for
your plane.
The Boeing does a loop the loop and passes over again, throwing
up enormous waves of sand. Radios lie scattered in all directions,
emitting a strange music of whale song and bleating goats.

Boeing – Int./Ext. – Day
The horrified head of a woman passenger with her hair sticking
straight up, nose pressed against the window.
Outside, in what looks like a corolla, a man appears to shoot up
feet first... Itʼs the ultralight pilot with his parachute.
Back in the Boeing, the passenger is belted into her seat, the plane
upside down with all loose items (hand baggage, trolleys, trays,
bottles etc.) now on the ceiling.

131

Beach – Ext. – Day
The wings of the ultralight crumple onto the sand, as the parachutist descends.
PARACHUTIST (to the people down below)
Look out! Get out of the way!
Animal music in the radios.
GUY ON BEACH
What is this shit? That’s it. This time they’ve really jumped
the shark.
He kicks a radio.
BOY
Where’s my plane? Has anybody seen my plane?

City – Ext. – Day
A limousine rolls down a wide avenue.
In the back seat, the President of the Investigation Commission
into Hertzian Disturbances discusses the matter with the commission spokesman.
SPOKESMAN (a sandwich in his hand )
Mr. President, do you really think we can let things go on
like this?
PRESIDENT
I don’t see why not ... as long as we downplay it.

132

SPOKESMAN
Downplay it, very well Mr. President. Pointless, then, to insist
on what happened at Sarrebrück, Agadir, Kingston...
PRESIDENT (nodding)
Hmm, quite pointless...
The car stops at the foot of a glass office tower. The two men get out
and head towards the entrance with its military guards.
PRESIDENT
Agadir?
SPOKESMAN
Yes Mr. President, the air disaster...
PRESIDENT
But there were no victims!
SPOKESMAN
No, no victims to speak of.
PRESIDENT
So we can forget about it, just let it drift on its silent wings far
from the public’s mind, especially as there haven’t been any
other incidents since, of any note. Have there?
SPOKESMAN
Well, one member of the Commission has raised an objection
regarding the F.A.H.
PRESIDENT
Refer him to the relevant technical sub-committee...

133

Factory – Int. – day
The tramp Fred encountered the night he arrived stands at the
foot of the building in the second courtyard. He furrows his brow,
perplexed by what he sees. Myriad bunches of cable cascade from
the upper floor where the laboratory is installed to enter other rooms
below. It looks as if the facade is in the grip of a giant octopus...
Manou appears at the kitchen window. The tramp hides behind
a wall.

Kitchen – Int. – Day
Manou, still at the window, addresses someone off-screen.
MANOU
I just saw someone.
VOICE-OFF (bizarre-sounding)
Who was it?
An intricate system of machines occupies the room. The voice
appears to be coming from a screen, on which we can distinguish
traits suggesting a face.
MANOU
Someone we don’t know, but I know him, because sometimes
I see him when I go to my special cave.
UIQ
Your case?
MANOU
No! My cave! Never mind, it’s too complicated. I’ll explain it to
you another time... Let’s get back to work.

134

The face decomposes. In its place a schematic three-dimensional
hand appears, with rings containing microchips on all six fingers.
MANOU
No I don’t want it like that!
UIQ
Why not? It’s good like that!
MANOU
No, I told you it’s not like that. There are too many fingers for
a start!
The image immediately corrects itself.
UIQ
Oh, sorry. My mistake. None…the…less… You did tell me I
forget, that you have only five fingers at present.
MANOU
Why? Was it different before?
UIQ
Yes! And so it will be again!
MANOU
Ah, yes! Of course, when we were all centipedes? Anyway, what
do we do now?
A list of materials scrolls down the screen.
UIQ
We have to assemble all this, and in order. You’ll see, it will be
easy as pie in the sky.

135

MANOU
Oh noooh! I’ll never be able to do all that. Wait, I’ll get Fred.
You stay here, okay?
She takes off in the direction of Janice’s space.

Corridor – Int. – Day
Manou tramples over the cables that have by now completely
invaded the corridors and interior spaces. She bursts into
Janice’s room.

Janice’s Space – Int. – Day
In Janice’s room, another workstation has been set up, huddled
around which we now find Steve, Axel and Fred. They watch
as complex graphs and mathematical formulae continue to flash
across the screen.
MANOU
Fred, you have to come right away.
FRED
What is it now?
MANOU
You have to help me. I don’t understand anything.
Fred sighs.
MANOU
Come on, it’s for the work UIQ and I are doing.

136

FRED
What work?
MANOU
To make a machine that fires bullets. Well, of course they’re
not real bullets... Because only I can see them. But people will
feel them when they get hit. Come on. It’ll be great. It’s an idea
I had. It’s really brilliant. UIQ thinks so too and he’s going to
do everything to see that it works. The only thing is he doesn’t
have hands or feet or a nose, or anything at all in fact. So you
have to come to help us with the welding and stuff.
Manou drags Fred out of the room.
Axel and Steve seem unconcerned by the equations that now fill
the screen.
STEVE (to the screen)
What you’re saying seems a million miles from our current
cosmological theories...
AXEL
… which are nonetheless based on pretty much irrefutable
experimental evidence!
The blurred face of UIQ, consisting of little more than the three
black holes of the eyes and mouth, appears on the screen.
UIQ
I am not contesting your experimental methods ... the problem
is your obsession with what you call the Big Bang theory ... you
cannot seem to escape it but it is a road to nowhere being that
the starting point is completely erroneous.

137

STEVE
How so?
UIQ
The expansion of the universe so called.
AXEL
And the Doppler-Fizeau effect?
UIQ
An illusion resulting from your anthropological perspective,
which is to say dependent on co-ordinates proper to beings
limited, discreet, defined, finite in space and time, according
to linear, irreversible sequences. Ours is another approach
to the cosmos, there being no reason to think in terms of a
before and after your so-called Big Bang. If such a thing exists,
then it must be happening everywhere and at every instant.
Is it clear enough? But let us by all means return to a physical
mathematical model.
The face disappears, once again replaced by mathematical formulae.
Suddenly we hear a series of cries, like the wails of a newborn
infant. Axel and Steve sigh in unison.

Michèle and Antoine’s Space – Int. – Day
The screams startle the two high school students as they enjoy an
intimate lunch together. They both look incensed.
STEVE
Not that again!
AXEL
I’ll go and see what’s happening.

138

STEVE (to the screen)
How is it a universe like you can be so cool with us and at the
same time such a dumb-ass with her?
UIQ
Steve, you know I like you a lot, but you can be a real nunce
sometimes. To be dumb-ass or not to be dumb-ass, that is the
question ... that was posed on the road to dumb-asscus...
The camera follows Axel to the laboratory.

Lab – Int. – Day
Much has changed in the lab where a mess of cables run in all
directions and a great disorder reigns.
Janice, her skull covered in electrodes connected to a new machine,
works with a welding gun on an integrated circuit.
Noticeably thinner and looking exhausted, she speaks to the
oscilloscope screen where the face of UIQ is visible...
JANICE
Easy, we’ll get there...
UIQ (whining)
Aah, Eee, Oooh, Vvv — Yeeeooooh, Aah, Eee, Vvv — Eee,
Oooh, Aaaah, Vvv...
JANICE
Sshh, quietly now... It’s okay, don’t worry, I’m here.
UIQ continues whining.

139

The sound is suddenly transformed into a piercing animal cry akin to
whale song. The face becomes deformed, its traits begin to fluctuate.
JANICE
No, don’t start that again, or I’ll stop right now, I’ll pull your plug!
UIQ recommences its infant wailing, sending Janice into a
violent, uncontrollable spasm. Axel rushes towards her, she looks
deathly pale. As he removes one of the electrodes from her forehead,
she jumps up.
JANICE
Don’t fucking touch that!
Axel backs off.
AXEL
What the hell is wrong with you?
JANICE
What’s wrong? I’ll tell you what’s wrong. You’re never there
when you’re supposed to be, I have to do everything. I’ve had
enough, he’s driving me up the fucking wall. And it’s all your
fault he’s like that!
AXEL
My fault?
JANICE
Yes, what he needs ... is a real male imago!
AXEL
A male what? What the fuck’s an imago?

140

JANICE
Forget it, forget it, your head’s bypassed the event horizon of
your ass. Oh, it’s easy playing equations all day when I have to
teach him his fucking ABCs and dry his liquid crystal tears!
AXEL
Look, get some rest. I’ll take over if you want.
JANICE
No way. You don’t know how to deal with him. I can just see it,
you’ll just get him on some fucking catastrophe theory trip and
I’ll come back and find him even more upset than when I left!
AXEL
Okay, okay. Have it your way. I’m not going to say another word.
Axel hoists himself up onto a bar overhead and hangs upside down.
UIQ stops crying and begins speaking again in a detached tone.
UIQ
I’m not going to say another word, I’m not going to say
another word.

International Commission Headquarters – Int. – Day
The face of a nervous-looking man appears in extreme close-up,
scrutinizing a TV screen where we see two superimposed images:
a gyrating stripper and the blurred and enigmatic face of UIQ.
A subtitle reads: “We apologise for these disturbances which are
beyond our control.”

141

He switches channel. The face is still there.
He inserts a tape into the VCR and presses record.
MALE VOICE-OFF
Play that back.
We are in a large glass-walled room where around thirty
technicians, engineers, researchers and military staff are busy
at their different workstations amid a febrile ambience of voices,
telephone call signals, etc. In one corner a group of statisticians are
in discussion in front of a giant electronic world map on which
three particular territories appear highlighted in different colours.
PRESIDENT
Ireland, maybe that can offer us a lead.
STATISTICIAN
Yes, but what about Uganda?
OTHER MAN
And Quebec? I don’t see the connection.
PRESIDENT
There must be a solution, we just have to find it. Why is it
that, out of all the world’s nations, these three countries
have been spared the disturbances? There must be some kind
of logical explanation...
STATISTICIAN (aside)
Yeah, right!
Near them, a military officer is on the phone trying to hear what
is being said to him.

142

OFFICER
Quiet, it’s NATO high command... They’re asking if the
Russians have been affected.
TECHNICIAN
Affected by what?
OFFICER
Well, stuff like that (he indicates the blurred face on the video
image).
STATISTICIAN
They probably know more than us about it, the commie faggots.
OFFICER
They’re saying the Russians think they may have experienced
something of the kind, but they’re not sure, they want us
to verify.
STATISTICIAN
Why don’t they fuck off back to Siberia.
On the other side of the glass panel, the spokesman for the International Commission is giving a press conference.
JOURNALIST
You’ve kept us hanging around here for six hours. So what
is it? What the fuck is going on? Can’t you try to be a little
more precise?
SPOKESMAN
All I can say at the present time is that we have the situation well
in hand. The disturbances are now completely under control.
As you can see, air traffic is back to operating normally and

143

all radio communications have been re-established. Including
with the countries of the Eastern Bloc.
One journalist indicates a TV screen where the blurred face is
plainly visible.
JOURNALIST
And what are you planning to do about Mr. Smiley there?
SPOKESMAN
There are of course still a few residual traces!
JOURNALIST
Call that a residual trace?
SPOKESMAN
It’s a completely harmless phenomenon, clearly an F.A.H.
effect: a Floating Anthropomorphic Halo.
ANOTHER JOURNALIST
About which you clearly know S.F.A.
SPOKESMAN
I must ask you to moderate your language, sir. While I understand your sentiments I must remind you that I represent
the International Commission which the Security Council has
charged by to investigate the phenomena of which we speak.

Manou & Robert’s Space – Int. – Day
Manou lies in the hammock making rhythmic movements with
her hand, which has odd-looking rings on all the fingers.

144

We hear an electric buzzing sound punctuated by short highpitched tones: she is playing with a kind of ball that appears in
the form of a red halo that she directs remotely to strike different
objects. The ball ricochets off a wall and hits Robert who jumps
back as though from an electric shock.
ROBERT
Ouch!
(He leaps up at one stroke). That’s it! Give me that thing. Now!
We told you not to play with it.
MANOU (with sweet insincerity)
Sorry... I didn’t mean to hit you!
ROBERT
That hurt. You want me to do it to you?
Manou shrugs and goes on with her game. Fred’s monkey has taken
cover on top of a wardrobe. From the corner of her eye, Manou
checks to make sure Robert isn’t looking before targeting the animal
with the ball. Strident squeals are heard as the monkey runs off.
Robert turns once again menacingly towards the little girl.
MANOU (playing innocent)
What’s up with her?

Factory – Ext. – Day
Jumping down from the hammock, she pursues the animal outside
across the two inner courtyards. After being hit several times, the
monkey disappears into the dark of a hangar. Manou goes looking
for it and runs into the tramp. Terrified, she freezes. Both of them
look each other up and down. Manou involuntarily directs the

145

ball at the tramp, hitting him square in the face. He howls in pain
before straightening up to protect himself, whipping out a knife
whose blade flashes in the darkness. Manou runs away as fast as
her legs can carry her.
We see Manou, pursued by the monkey who gnashes her teeth.
Out in the yard, she trips and falls head first into a dark puddle.
She gets up, wrings out her skirt and sees Eric sitting on the edge
of the puddle, methodically stripping away an old crate. With his
teeth he cuts the wood into sticks of different lengths that he then
measures in a kind of ritual.
MANOU
What are you doing?
Eric doesn’t answer. Manou takes off her “rings” and slips them
inside her pocket to watch Eric. The red halo disappears.
The schizo meticulously selects a small piece of wood, which he
throws into the water, aiming at a precise spot on the surface. He
does the same with a second piece. Manou gathers up a handful
of sticks that she throws in at random. Surprise! The pieces form
themselves into a face.
Manou stops to contemplate the face for an instant, then picks up
a baton and agitates the water with it, making it look as though
the face is laughing.
Eric gathers up the metallic pastilles that he had placed around
the puddle. The face decomposes, slipping piece by piece beneath
the water.
We hear a moaning sound coming from the laboratory. Manou
raises her eyes towards the upper floor of the building.

146

Lab – Int. – Day
No longer wearing electrodes, Janice approaches the screen where
UIQ’s face is visible.
JANICE
What’s wrong?
The closer she gets, the more the face of UIQ appears to diminish
in size. When she is sitting next to him, they are the same size, and
he’s partly masked by her head.
JANICE
I don’t know whether you’re really confused or you’re just
jerking me around. I’ve already explained to you a hundred
times the notion of the sexuated individual.
UIQ
Yes, tell me about that... Oh please, tell me again.
JANICE
I’m getting a bit tired of repeating myself.
UIQ
You don’t want to talk to me anymore, is that it?
JANICE
No, but … look, let’s take it from the beginning, most living
things are created from the conjunction of two types of beings
that are at once similar and different, a father and a mother,
but it’s not always the case.
As UIQ speaks, we pass to Michèle and Antoine’s room. Antoine
is lying down on his stomach. Michèle leans over his naked torso,

147

squeezing blackheads and spots, several of which ooze inordinate
quantities of pus. Antoine grimaces with pain, trying not to cry out.
UIQ (off )
Yes, snails I understand. Therefore it’s only when there is, as
you say, sexuated reproduction. So, what does this difference in
sexes consist of? Does it only concern the enchaining of DNA
and RNA sequences in the genetic encoding? And if thatʼs the
case, how does one explain the need for the phases of development and learning? So many questions... Does the distinction
between two beings always have a genetic base? Do they need
to be co-present? The phenomena of interaction seem to suggest as much... And yet is this still true when the two beings are
billions and billions of light years apart, or when they belong
to incomparable systems of coordinates? As it is between your
system and ours.
JANICE
You just said it, “your system and ours.” You see, you understand perfectly well the distinction between two beings.
UIQ
Yours, mine, ours. You, me, you, me. You … yes I understand
you. But me... Me, I’ll never get it. This face on the screen is
only for you. And if you want that I ... that I change it...
UIQʼs face metamorphoses, its traits become deformed, passing
through a series of changes to end up in the shape of a grotesque
mask though the two eyes and mouth subsist.
UIQ
Do you like me like this?
JANICE
Not really... I preferred the way you were before...

148

UIQ
As you wish!
UIQ returns to the previous image.
UIQ
But let us stick to our knitting... Iʼm sorry, but I think we have
to go back to a higher level, to the opposition between here and
there... You didn’t give me an answer. Is there always a sexual
opposition? You see, in what you call my Infra-quark Universe,
there is no axiomatic system establishing polar distinctions of
the type you-me. There, if I ... if I ... may say so, beings delimit
themselves without limiting each other. From this it might
be possible to proceed in two directions: your fuzzy logic,
but it seems a bit vague, a bit embryonic ... or another, more
promising logic I would say, that of poetry...

Park – Ext. – Day
At the foot of a monumental stairway, lined with statues. Laden
with a big cardboard box, Eric throws handfuls of grain towards
the pigeons which flock around him to the point that he becomes
almost invisible under a cloud of beating wings. Not far from
him Manou, wearing a microphone-equipped headset, is in
conversation with UIQ. She circles around Eric, placing little
metallic pastilles on the ground.
MANOU
Is that it? Enough? More? Don’t you think you’re overdoing
it? There won’t be any left for tomorrow.
Suddenly a vehement speech resounds through the park. On the
esplanade, at the top of the steps, a hysterical preacher standing on
a wooden box harangues a growing, anxious crowd of onlookers. He
holds up a large banner on which we recognize UIQʼs blurred face.

149

PREACHER
In truth it was all written. Beware!
(He points at a woman) Beware sinner! Have you no shame!
I speak the truth. Only he who submits will be spared the
final punishment!
SOMEONE IN THE CROWD
What submission?
PREACHER (brandishing his banner)
The voices of Ravish Naik are impenetrable. Beware, I tell
you, the end is near! Now my disciples will pass among you to
receive your offerings and mark you with the sword of
Ravish Naik.
Some rather moronic-looking followers ringing small bells pass
through the crowd with bowls. Others mark the foreheads of the
donors with a red felt tip pen. Some begin to undress to jeers from
the crowd. Women offer up their babies in supplication.
PREACHER
The end is near. You must submit! Ravish Naik speaks through
me. Yes, night is drawing near. All will be defeated and the
sword of judgement will divide the just from the unjust, virtue
from ignominy. Yes, you heard what I said. Ignominy. Submit!
A wave of astonishment surges through the crowd as columns of
pigeons rise noisily into the air in a fluster of wings, their scattered
calligraphy recomposing to form an apparently smiling face.
The stunned face of the preacher.
Terrorised, the screaming crowds disperse. In the panic, a pram
escapes and trundles towards the steps which it begins to descend,

150

gathering speed as it goes. Miraculously it is halted half-way down
by a distant gesture from Eric.
A police helicopter flies through the face formed by the pigeons.
The co-pilot leans out to look down at the scattering crowd and sees
that it too composes a face.
The co-pilot takes photographs of the scene.

Employment Agency Waiting Room – Int. – Day
Among those waiting their turn are Michèle and Antoine; they
converse in hushed voices, leaning against a message board.
ANTOINE
But you know, that’s not the way I see it … they’re all pretty
sickening, but if you want to know it’s Robert who really makes
me puke. I mean, you have to take responsibility...
MICHÈLE
Oh darling, you’re so right!
ANTOINE (mechanically picking up a newspaper from an
empty chair)
Hey, check this out!
Two large photos appear on the front page, one of the crowd,
the other of the pigeons, each forming the shape of a face.
Above them runs the headline: PANIC AT OST PARK.
MICHÈLE
What is it?

151

ANTOINE
It’s their cosmic muppet again!
A female head pops up above the message board. The woman
listens with interest to everything they say.
ANTOINE
It can take whatever form it wants, one minute it’s in the sky,
the next in the crowd, but it’s the same thing. It can appear in
a freak weather front, in radio interference, in anything... That
thing is dangerous.
MICHÈLE
Yes, but one day … someone’s going to nail them.
ANTOINE
Sshh, not so loud! Someone might hear.
A number appears on the screen.
MICHÈLE
27, isn’t that us?
ANTOINE
Yes, it’s our turn, come on!

Lab – Int. – Day
Naked, Axel is doing pushups.
AXEL
17, 18, 19, 20, 21...
UIQ punctuates his movements with a rhythmic chanting.

152

Janice looks at him, laughs and undresses. She approaches him but
he pushes her away.
AXEL
Donʼt get me wrong, Iʼm not gay or anything. But you know
how it is with women...
She shrugs and moves away. He gets up and lunges at her, bites one
of her buttocks causing her to cry out. He leaps on top of her and
pins her to the ground.
As their gestures become more and more erotic, Eric falls into a
catatonic stupor.
UIQ stops singing and begins signalling to Manou, drawing her
attention to what is going on between Axel and Janice.
Manou shrugs with a knowing air.
MANOU
So what? Leave them to it.
UIQ groans.
As though they were alone, Janice and Axel dance around the room
caressing each other, while UIQ like a disgruntled infant makes a
series of despairing grimaces.
MANOU (to UIQ)
What…? What’s up with you?
UIQ, its pathetic expression unchanging, tries to make her understand its unease.

153

AXEL
Stop! Wait a sec...
He leans over Janice, who smiles at him in extreme close-up.
On the screen UIQʼs face smiles in the exact same way.
As Janice and Axel go on caressing, we see UIQ assume the expressions of ecstasy of one and the other in turn. We hear it moan
with pleasure.
Immobile as a statue, Eric stands on a chair, pointing his finger
towards some invisible object.
Under the bed sheets, Axel and Janiceʼs excitement rises, as on
the screen UIQʼs face goes into convulsions. Suddenly it emits
a dreadful guttural cry, like that of some animal, a cry that
seems interminable.
Axel leaps up, furious and panicked. UIQʼs cry begins to die away
to a pitiful lament.
AXEL (extremely angry)
Iʼve had it with this shit! Whatʼs up with him?
MANOU (to Axel )
Youʼre not nice to him...
The monkey goes crazy and begins jumping from machine to
machine, finally landing on Eric who doesn’t move a muscle
even when the animal defecates down his shirt.
Janice gets dressed.

154

JANICE (to UIQ)
Calm down, it’s okay, they’re going... We can talk now, you
know, talk ... just you and me.
Axel, still upset, hurriedly puts his clothes on.
AXEL
I’ve fucking had it with you two!
He leaves, followed by Manou carrying the monkey.
Janice moves closer to UIQ on the screen, who continues to groan.
Eric is still standing on the stool.
JANICE
Listen, you’re gonna have to help me here ... otherwise I canʼt
help you. Whatʼs wrong? You know what I think, I think
youʼre jealous...
UIQ
Jealous? Je loss?
JANICE
Yes, jealous.
UIQ
So itʼs a question of body, of flesh, skin, possession...

Factory – Int. – Evening
Sitting at the foot of the metal staircase leading to the laboratory,
Manou converses with UIQ through her headset.

155

MANOU
What? What did you say? We’re going to give him something
special ... tell me again, what do I have to put in it?
UIQ (off )
Glucose, potassium chloride, dl-tocopherol acetate, vitamin E,
ephynal...
MANOU
What’s that?
UIQ (off )
Look in the drug cabinet. It’s a bottle of little pills. You just
have to crush them to a powder.

Kitchen – Int. – Evening
Manou opens the drug cabinet, but the monkey, much faster than
her, grabs the bottles she’s looking for. She gives it a smack. Then
she begins emptying the different bottles into a mortar, grinding
the contents down into a powder that she then dilutes with water
before pouring the mixture through a coffee filter.
FRED
What are you cooking up there?
MANOU
Nothing to do with you.
She takes the monkey.
FRED (indicating the whitish mixture in the cafetiere)
You going to give her that?

156

MANOU
What do you think I am? I’m not mad, you know!
FRED
Stay here, Lara!
He tries to take back the monkey, but it attaches itself to Manou.

Factory – Ext. / Int. – Evening
We follow the girl into the courtyard.
MANOU (to UIQ)
What do you want me to do? I’m scared.
UIQ (off )
No... I’m sure you’re very happy! You like playing doctor,
don’t you.
Manou enters the dark hangar. She turns on a small torch. In the
beam we see the tramp, lying dead drunk among piles of rubbish.
UIQ (off )
Go on.
MANOU
What if he wakes up?
UIQ (off )
Gently does it.
Manou carefully empties the contents of the cafetiere into a
half-empty wine bottle.

157

MANOU
Eugh! It’s disgusting!
The tramp stirs in his sleep, Manou switches off the torch. He
grumbles in the dark, we hear him grab the bottle and guzzle
down its contents.

Street – Ext. – Evening
The street is almost deserted. Michèle and Antoine walk hand in
hand along the sidewalk.
ANTOINE
You remember that Kipling poem … how does it go again?
MICHÈLE
You mean the story about what it is to be a man?
ANTOINE
That’s it: “If you can ... watch the things you gave your life
to, broken...
A car pulls up alongside them, shrieking to a halt.
ANTOINE
...and lose, and start at your beginnings, and never breathe a
word about your loss... you’ll be a man, my son.”
I wish I’d had a father who spoke to me like that.
Two men get out of the car, grab the teenagers and bundle them
into the back seat. The car takes off.

158

Hangar – Int. – Day
Under the glare of a white light, the tramp lies on the ground,
connected to a drip, he seems to be in a dreadful state. Manou goes
up to him and lifts one of his eyelids, shuddering with revulsion.
MANOU (to UIQ, through the headset)
He’s going to die, isn’t he?
UIQ (off )
Oh no, on the contrary...
She gets up on tiptoe to try to stop the drip, but as she’s not tall
enough, she has to step onto the tramp’s body which emits a grumbling sound. She regulates the drip with precision as the monkey
roots around in the garbage, eating whatever it can find.
MANOU (to UIQ)
What do I do now?
UIQ (off )
Whatever you like. Why not take his temperature?
MANOU
Eugh, disgusting pig!
UIQ
Listen to his heart.
Manou picks up a stethoscope and places it on the tramp’s chest.
MANOU
I can’t hear anything.

159

UIQ (off )
It’s true it hasn’t got much of a beat, but it’s interesting nonetheless.
She looks at the tramp. He is clearly in a very bad way.
MANOU
I’m going to call the doctor.
UIQ (off )
No, there’s no point. Put the biopastilles on him!
MANOU
The what?
UIQ
You know, the little sweets.
MANOU
Where?
UIQ (off )
Here and there. All over.
Hesitant at first, Manou finally obeys, placing pastilles at certain
precise points on the tramp’s body: three in triangular formation on
the cheek, others on the chest and arms.

Lab – Int. – Day
Janice sits next to the screen, as she speaks to UIQ.
UIQ
Come closer, it’s important. Touch my face with yours.

160

Janice places her head against the blurred face, which makes her
own face glow, outlining it with a shimmering halo.
UIQ
You know, I’m actually very aware of all the ... stress I’ve put
you through. But you must admit, it wasn’t easy for me to get
to the point I am now. It’s thanks to you if I’ve managed. And
now I’m going to stop being a nuisance. I’ve found a radical
solution that will change everything...
JANICE
What?
UIQ
It’s difficult to say... It’s something that all humans no doubt
experience at some time in their lives ... but for me it is unique.
Janice, I love you absolutely and I want us to be ... married.
You’ll see from now on, everything will be different, I swear!
This infantile phase is complete, I am done with it and now
you can really count on me. You, your friends, humanity. There
are many things I can do. I can do everything.
JANICE
And what do you plan to do?
UIQ
Well, I don’t know, maybe an AIDS vaccine, a solution to global famine, eradication of world pollution, all the pollution...
JANICE
Okay, great, but what about this marriage business? You want
a real wedding? With flowers? And a priest? Who’s going to be
your best man?

161

She bursts into laughter.
UIQ
Don’t laugh, I beg you, don’t laugh at me!
JANICE
Don’t take it the wrong way. It’s not you after all.
UIQ
I’ll take care of everything.

Hangar – Int. – Day
The tramp wakes up and utters a last gasp, before he slumps
down dead.
Distraught, Manou gathers up her headset and runs away. The
camera follows her as she makes her way back to the kitchen.

Kitchen – Int. –Day
Robert is wired up to Fred, Steve, Axel and Jennifer. Manou
arrives, in a state of shock.
JENNIFER
What happened honey?
Manou doesn’t respond. She starts to cry.
ROBERT
What are you crying about? Christ, you can be a pain sometimes...

162

MANOU (between sobs)
It wasn’t my fault...
JENNIFER
Fault, what fault ... explain?
MANOU (crying as she speaks)
It’s because he’s dead.
STEVE
Who’s dead? Who are you talking about?
MANOU
I don’t know. You don’t know him, it’s not my fault... I didn’t
want him to die.
ROBERT
Go and play, it’s nothing.
Axel’s ears prick up as he hears a muffled sound from a room
nearby. He gets up and heads to Janice’s room.

Janice’s Space – Int. – Day
Axel confirms that the noises are real. There is undoubtedly
someone in the room. He opens the door a crack to peer in.
A close-up of Axel reveals his angered surprise. He kicks open the
door and we glimpse the back of a man who doesn’t turn round.
Axel leaps at the intruder who deftly steps aside to watch Axel sail
past him and crash to the floor with a cry of pain.

163

STRANGER (off )
You okay?
Axel looks at him, nonplussed.
AXEL (stammering)
Who the fuck are you? What are you doing there? Are you
from the feds? You’ve no right to be here. And that’s my tie!
We don’t have a complete view of the intruder’s face, which only
serves to increase the air of mystery and fascination that surrounds
him. He undoes the tie and hands it back to Axel.
AXEL (stuttering)
My shirt, trousers...
STRANGER
Sorry old boy, it’s not exactly the tropics...
AXEL
Who are you?
STRANGER
I came to see Janice.
He goes out of the room. Axel follows him, dazed.

Kitchen – Int. – Day
As the unknown visitor enters, the room falls silent. Standing
behind him, Axel seems frozen.
ROBERT (to Axel, extremely worried )
What does he want? Is he a cop?

164

AXEL
I don’t think so.
ROBERT (to the stranger)
Who are you?
Before the stranger has time to reply, Manou goes up to him and
observes him from below. In extreme close-up, we see a triangle of
beauty spots on his cheek.
STRANGER
Don’t mind me. Is there any coffee?
He goes over to the cupboard.
STEVE
Help yourself! Like us to rustle you up a full English breakfast?
STRANGER
Who wants one?
MANOU
I’d like one.
He takes Manou in his arms and lifts her up, so she can get the
coffee filters from the top shelf. Manou leans against his cheek,
stroking the beauty spots with a finger.
MANOU
What are those?
He looks at her straight in the eye. Manou bursts into a fit
of giggles.

165

MANOU (raising her arms to be lifted again)
Again! Again!
He lifts her up.
ROBERT
What do you want here?
STRANGER
I’m here to see Janice.
MANOU
Come with me.
Manou jumps into the man’s arms and once again puts her hand
on his beauty spots.
MANOU
Why don’t you want to tell them?
STRANGER
Tell them what?
MANOU
You know perfectly well what!
He puts his finger in her mouth and strokes her teeth.
MANOU (freeing herself )
You dirty old man.
JENNIFER
What are you doing with her? Let her go.

166

STRANGER
Nothing untoward, I assure you. Worry not.
Manou unbuttons his shirt.
STRANGER
What are you up to?
MANOU
Just looking at something.
A gentle struggle ensues.
MANOU
Yes, that’s it!
(To the others) I’m going to take him to see Janice.
Everybody looks stunned.
We follow Manou and the stranger to the laboratory entrance.
MANOU
What’s your name?
STRANGER
Whatever you want. What would you like it to be?
MANOU
Umm, I don’t know... Artichoke, no, that’s not a proper
name ... how about Bruno. Bruno, do you like it?
BRUNO
Okay, Bruno it is then. Bruno Artichoke!
She laughs.

167

MANOU (indicating the trap door at the top of the stairs)
It’s there!
He tries to open it only to find it blocked.
MANOU (to Janice)
Hey, Janice! It’s Bruno.
JANICE (off )
Bruno?
MANOU
Bruno Artichoke!
A church organ fills the building with the strains of Chopin’s
wedding march.

International Commission HQ – Ext./Int.– Day
A young uniformed policewoman walks through the revolving
doors carrying a tray of cream cakes.
She carries the tray to an office where we find Michèle and Antoine
surrounded by the President, the Spokesman and assorted bureaucrats and military men.
PRESIDENT
Ah, ammunition. Help yourselves, please. Now, let me see if
I have this clear. So what you’re saying is that this ... extraterrestrial amuses itself by creating interference, television, air
traffic control and so on... But have you seen it? Michèle, what
about you?

168

MICHÈLE (hesitating)
Yes, I think so.
PRESIDENT
Yes or no?
ANTOINE
Yes, Mr. President. We have.
SPOKESMAN
You saw it? You touched it?
ANTOINE
No, no, it’s not like that.
MICHÈLE
You can never touch it.
PRESIDENT
Calm down, listen my young friends. This extra-terrestrial …
how did it find its way here?
Antoine and Michèle give a shrug.
PRESIDENT
Is it armed?
ANTOINE
No, Sir.
OFFICER
So it can’t be dangerous then?

169

MICHÈLE
Oh yes, because it can take any form it wants.
ANTOINE
And sometimes it goes completely crazy...
OTHER MAN
Crazy?
POLICEMAN
So how about we take a gander down at the factory, Mr. President?
PRESIDENT
Relax, superintendent! For the moment there are to be no
fireworks. We don’t want another Brussels, do we? The way I
see it, we must exercise extreme caution.
SPOKESMAN
If I may ask, Mr. President...
PRESIDENT
What is it?
SPOKESMAN
How do you see the situation?
The president gives a shrug and bites into a cream cake.

Factory – Lab Staircase – Int. – Day
The whole community is gathered at the foot of the metal staircase
below the trap door, anxiously listening for strange noises.

170

ROBERT
We have to go in, we can’t leave her with him.
He tries to shoulder open the trap door but only succeeds in
injuring himself.
ROBERT
Ow!
AXEL
Wait, I can try to get in by the window.

Factory – Ext./Int. – Day
Axel scales the facade of the building and hoists himself up onto
the roof terrace. He goes to the window and presses his face against
the glass.
Janice sees him.
JANICE
I thought I told you to stay out of my way!
AXEL
Are you ok? What’s going on?
JANICE
It’s fine. It’s fine, now go.
UIQ (anxious, to Janice)
What’s the problem now? I don’t understand. I’m there
now … there I am, in flesh and blood. We can finally get
married. It’s wonderful!

171

JANICE (to UIQ)
Shut that fucking face, you’re sick! Sick in the head except you
don’t have a head. It’s crazy, what you’re suggesting. Fucking
gaga. I should have known. Oh fuck, I should have known.
But who would believe any of this shit?
She starts to kick the machines. Bruno switches the oscilloscope off.
UIQ’s face disappears. Janice calms down.
JANICE (to Bruno)
Look, it’s not you. I’ve nothing against ... you. But this ... this
procedure... It’s unbearable. I can’t... I see now what a mistake
this has been, for months I was sucked in, but now it’s clear.
Incredible. Every time, it was never enough, he always wanted
more. He just used me up. I think I must be going mad.
BRUNO (whose face remains hidden)
You’re right. What can I say? The whole situation is ...
completely warped... I understand you... I’m going.
JANICE
Where? Where the fuck are you gonna go?
BRUNO
It doesn’t matter where.
Janice turns to look at him, with an expression of almost
unbearable intensity.

Factory – Ext. – Day
A car draws up alongside the factory buildings. Inside are the
Commision president, a police officer and Antoine and Michèle,
both of whom look tense and ill at ease.

172

MICHÈLE (pointing at the building)
It’s there.
The president presses his nose up to the glass, scrutinizes the metal
gate and tries to see into the dilapidated courtyard beyond.
PRESIDENT
That’s where they’re hiding out?
ANTOINE
Yes, I mean behind there.
PRESIDENT
Well, we don’t want to give ourselves away quite so soon, do
we Driver...
POLICE OFFICER (into a walkie-talkie)
Order all vehicles to take up discreet positions following
plan A and to stay on guard! Marksmen to keep out of sight
and not to engage until the order is given ... understood?
We see armed men scurrying across the roof of a nearby building,
taking up their positions while others scan the factory through
binoculars. Several unmarked cars pull up outside the factory.

Janice’s Space – Int. – Day
Naked under the shower, Bruno rinses his body. As the soap
bubbles dissolve, we gradually discover a series of beauty spots forming the same pattern as the “pastilles” on the body of the tramp.
Janice, also naked, throws him a towel. Bruno rubs himself dry,
while Janice approaches him and starts to caress his beauty spots.

173

JANICE
What are these? They’re amazing!
Bruno lifts the hair from the back of her neck and leans forward
to breathe in her smell.
BRUNO
No, this is amazing!
For the first time we see Bruno’s face.
Suddenly, a glow invades the screen, merely colours at first, then a
face, that of UIQ.
Janice looks alternately at one and the other.
JANICE
How do you two work it out between yourselves?
BRUNO
Simple. He is him and Iʼm me.
JANICE
Yes, but who does what?
Bruno takes her in his arms.
BRUNO
I do everything.
UIQ gives him the finger.
JANICE
And what about me, what the fuck has this got to do with me?

174

Bruno traces a hyperbole of n dimensions on the screen. A trellis of
lines appears across which we see a point of light moving rapidly.
BRUNO
You see the point? The point is you.
JANICE (alarmed )
And whereʼs the way out of this system of yours?
BRUNO
That, my dear, is another story...
JANICE (to UIQ)
No, it’s a fucking nightmare!
The sound of organ music returns.
BRUNO (to UIQ)
Easy on the bass pedals!
(To Janice) Say, this is all very nice, but I’m getting a bit hungry...
JANICE
I’ll go and look for something. Wait here. Do you want something to drink? Wine, beer…?
BRUNO (turning towards UIQ)
How about some Beaujolais?
A list of different vintages and producers scrolls down UIQ’s forehead.
A 1976 Morgon Côte du Py?

175

JANICE
What do you think this is? Claridges? You’ll just have to take
what we’ve got.
She quickly gets dressed and goes out shrugging her shoulders.
Bruno gets into bed and makes himself comfortable. He lights a
cigarette and grabs a copy of “Road Runner.”
UIQ starts to cough.
(indicating the magazine) Why are you reading that crap?
BRUNO
What do you know, imbecile? I like looking at the images,
purely for the beauty of the forms, not the performance. I don’t
give a shit about the rest of it.
UIQ
It is nonetheless rather irritating.

Kitchen – Int. – Day
Janice opens all the cupboards. They’re empty.
AXEL
So?
JANICE
So what? What’s up with you? Why the long face?
Axel goes back to where Steve is working, composing different systems of algorithms on the computer screen.
JANICE
You could do the shopping once in a while.

176

AXEL
Robert has the flu.

Factory – Ext. – Day
Janice descends the hillside road. We see her image framed by
binoculars, unseen eyes that discreetly follow her at a distance.
Suddenly a motorbike screeches to a halt at her feet, narrowly
avoiding ploughing into her.
HELMUT
Get on!
JANICE
Hey Lone Ranger!
Helmut honks a strangely musical-sounding horn. Janice smiles
and gets on behind him.

Car – Ext./ Int. – Day
POLICEMAN
Get the registration. I want to know who that biker is!

Janice’s Space – Int. – Night
Lying on the bed, Bruno puffs nervously on a cigarette.
UIQ
Where is she?
BRUNO
Gone shopping.

177

UIQ
Why doesn’t she come back?
BRUNO
Stop whining, she’ll be back!
UIQ
You don’t care, say it? You don’t give a shit either way.
BRUNO
No, don’t say that.
UIQ
You don’t know what it is ... to suffer.
BRUNO
That’s rich coming from you. After what you’ve put me through.
UIQ
It’s not the same. I’m talking about real suffering, absolute
suffering. No, you don’t know what that is!
BRUNO
In any case you always know everything.
UIQ
Yes, everything. So what if I do? You want to know what else?
They’ve got us surrounded.
BRUNO
Who?

178

UIQ
The feds. There’s a whole army of them. On the roofs, they’re
everywhere!
BRUNO
We have to warn the others.
UIQ
Let’s go look for Janice.
BRUNO
Janice, I don’t know where she’s gone.
UIQ
Oh, that’s easy. She’s gone back to the club, with her shitty friends.
BRUNO
Ok, let’s go.

Road – Ext. – Night
The van is followed at a discreet distance by an unmarked police
car. Axel is at the wheel, Bruno beside him, with UIQ no more
than a voice-off that speaks in counterpoint to Bruno.
UIQ (off )
Step on it!
BRUNO
Cool it, will you.
AXEL
What is it? I can’t go any faster. Where’s the fire?

179

UIQ
Not the fire. The feds!
Axel looks in the rear-view mirror and sees the car following them
at a distance.
AXEL
I’ll take care of this.
He steps on the gas. A chase ensues. After shaking off their pursuers,
they dump the van and continue on foot.
Bruno and Axel walk along the edge of a canal.
UIQ (off, to Bruno)
Why did you let her go? Answer me!
Bruno walks in a reluctant hurry as though he were being pushed
from behind. As they break into a run, he overtakes Axel and
knocks over a woman who topples a parked scooter as she falls. At
that moment a lorry arrives and screetches to a halt.
BRUNO (to UIQ)
Careful shithead!
Outraged, the woman turns to face him.
BRUNO
I’m sorry, but...
UIQ (off )
This is no time for gallantry, get a move on!
The woman looks on, dumbstruck.

180

Club – Int. – Night
Cold wave music. The club is packed.
UIQ (off )
Where is she? What do you see?
BRUNO
Nothing, I don’t see her.
UIQ (off )
Then look. Use your eyes. I’m telling you she’s here somewhere, I know it.
Bruno mingles with the crowd. Axel grabs him by the shoulder.
AXEL (to Bruno)
Hey, take it easy man, let’s get a drink.
Axel and Bruno sit down at a table
UIQ (off )
I know perfectly well what’s going on! She’s, she’s canoodling
with someone, isn’t she, the trollop!
We see Janice dancing close with Helmut on the dancefloor. UIQ
sends a shock through Bruno who tries to stand up and collapses
back onto his seat.
UIQ (off )
Do something! Go on, or I’ll tear the whole place apart.
BRUNO
She can dance if she wants!

181

The waiter approaches the table to take their order.
UIQ (off )
Smash the bastard’s fucking face in!
Astonished face of the waiter.
AXEL (to the waiter)
Beat it. We’re ok for the moment...
He gets up and goes to look for Janice on the dancefloor. He grabs
her by the wrist, pushing Helmut away.
AXEL (whispering in her ear)
I really think you should come with me.
JANICE
What? What’s going on?
AXEL
It’s Bruno, I mean UIQ. I think they have some issues to sort out!
JANICE
Frankly they can go fuck each other, for all I care.
She grabs Helmut’s arm and drags him towards the exit.
AXEL
And the feds are on our ass!
UIQ (off )
What are you waiting for? Go on. Do him!

182

BRUNO
I told you, no.
UIQ (off )
Mash the fucker to a pulp!
All of a sudden, we hear screams from a group of youths gathered
around a video-game that begins flashing dementedly.

Club – Ext. – Night
Janice and Helmut walk along the canal, kissing. Suddenly Bruno
looms up behind them. Sensing footsteps, Janice turns around.
JANICE (to Helmut)
Let’s move.
She begins to walk faster.
BRUNO (to UIQ)
I’m not going to let you do that. It’s revolting, what you’re
suggesting.
UIQ (off )
Don’t you get it? He’s going to stick it in!
The streetlamps along the road begin to buzz and flicker as though
affected by an electromagnetic storm, their light fluctuating
violently in rhythm and intensity. In a series of stroboscopic flashes
we see Axel running after Bruno.
A truck comes juddering along the roadside behind him. It mounts
the sidewalk and brushes Axel, who has just enough time to throw
himself out of its path.

183

In the cabin, the driver looks with alarm at the crazily spinning
dials of his instrument panel which emit a light strong enough to
momentarily blind him.
We hear the sound of the shattering windscreen as he loses control
of the vehicle which zigzags wildly, skims past Bruno and narrowly
avoids crushing Janice and her companion, before it veers onto
the bridge over the canal, crashes through the wooden barrier and
plunges into the water.
Axel observes the accident, aghast, under the infernal din of
the streetlamps.
BRUNO (to UIQ)
Enough of this bullshit!
UIQ (off )
Faster!
BRUNO (still running)
No, I won’t do it!
He comes up behind Janice and Helmut brandishing a switchblade. Janice tries to block his path with her body but he shoves her
out of the way and leaps upon the youth, stabbing him multiple
times with the knife.
Janice looks on in horror.
Axel arrives running, grabs Janice and tells her to run for it.
Bruno gazes down like a madman upon the inert body lying
stretched out on the pavement.

184

BRUNO (to UIQ)
You bastard, you fuck, you fucking murderer!
He throws the knife away and stares disorientedly at the lights that
continue to flicker and glow violently.
BRUNO (to UIQ)
You’re finished motherfucker!
Your puppet-master days are over. I’m going to cut your
fucking strings.
UIQ groans heavily.
UIQ (off )
It’s not my fault! She doesn’t love me anymore. You don’t know
how unhappy I am. Please. You have to help me. Please!
BRUNO (to UIQ)
You could have sorted this out fifty-thousand other ways!
UIQ (off )
Oh I don’t lack means, that’s for sure. But that’s only in science
and technology. As for these feelings, these ... passions, I don’t
know what to do with them, I’m lost. She doesn’t love me anymore. Janice doesn’t love me anymore. You don’t know what
that means, you’ll never understand. My suffering. My suffering is incommensurable. And it’s never going to end. Never.
BRUNO (to UIQ)
Oh, get over yourself!
He runs off as little by little the lights begin to dim.

185

Street – Ext. – Night
All vehicles have come to a standstill, their headlamps no longer
working. Dragging Janice by the arm, Axel wrenches open a car
door and hauls the driver out of his seat, taking his place.
AXEL (to driver)
Fuck off, this is an emergency!
He speeds off, glancing in the rear-view mirror, where he sees an
abandoned infant still strapped into a baby-seat. He reverses the
car, steering with one hand while loosening the child’s belt with
the other.
AXEL (to driver)
Here, don’t forget your sprog!
Just as he is about to drive off, Bruno arrives running. Headlamps
off, Axel hits the accelerator, slaloming wrecklessly to avoid
obstacles, climbing onto the sidewalk and tipping the car onto two
wheels before regaining traction and speeding off down the road.
As he approaches the factory, he sees the road ahead blocked by
brasiers. He slams on the brakes.
POLICEMAN
You can’t go that way!
AXEL
Why, what’s happening?
POLICEMAN
None of your concern!

186

ANOTHER POLICEMAN
Who are you? Licence and registration please!
Manou descends from the back of a police van where we see all the
other squatters except Eric. She walks up to Axel.
MANOU
Ah there you are, I’m coming with you.
She gets into the car as the police look on, speechless. Axel reverses
violently, opening Janice’s door.
AXEL
Get out! It’s too dangerous. Take Manou!
MANOU
No, I want to go with you!
Before she can finish her sentence, Janice already has her out of
the car.
JANICE (to Manou)
Where are the others?
Manou points towards the van.

Factory – Int. / Ext. – Night
At a window, armed with his mirror, Eric channels a beam of
light towards the marksmen hidden in the courtyard. The light
casts a faint reflection that skitters across the space until it alights
upon the helmet of one of them, at which point it unleashes a
luminous bolt of unbearable intensity. The shooter howls in pain,
dropping his weapon and raising his hands to cover his face.

187

Shots ring out, the mirror shatters in pieces. Eric gathers up several
shards that he manipulates to produce more beams, unleashing
further bolts of intense light.
POLICEMAN
Cease fire. Fall back!
The marksmen retreat from their positions as Axel arrives on
the scene.
POLICEMAN
What are you doing here?
AXEL
None of your fucking business!
A bolt narrowly misses him.
AXEL (to Eric)
Stop playing the infant. Let me come in.
As soon as he recognizes Axel’s voice, Eric lays down his shards of
mirror and scoops up Fred’s monkey which he begins to cradle in
his arms. Axel climbs up the building façade, bursting into the lab
through the window.
ERIC (indicating the mirror)
Francis ... he’s there...
UIQ (off )
And Dominique ... they killed her.
ERIC
It’s not true, it’s not true. What are you saying?

188

UIQ (off )
Francis and Dominique, they killed them both.
ERIC
Shut up, what do you know? They’re both here with me.
UIQ (off, screaming)
They’re dead, I tell you. Dead!
AXEL
Both of you, calm down. Enough with this bullshit. Now’s not
the time. Get yourselves sorted. We have to get out of here.
UIQ (off, screaming)
Get out? You’ve got to be shitting me. No way are we leaving
now. The fuckers capped Francis!
Suddenly, UIQ appears in the form of a human-sized hologram.
AXEL
Listen, it’s okay. We’re going to set everything up again
someplace else.
UIQ
What? You want to separate Janice and me?
AXEL
It won’t be for long. Just the time to find a quieter place...
UIQ
But I don’t want to leave her.

189

AXEL
Don’t worry! She’ll be there!
UIQ
Where is Janice? Why isn’t she here?
AXEL
She had to leave. There are cops everywhere!
UIQ
I don’t give a fuck about the cops!
AXEL
Just stop it! Haven’t you caused enough trouble?
Suddenly, beside the hologram, UIQ appears again on the large
screen in the form of the face. The two materialisations of the
Infra-quark Universe speak at the same time.
UIQ
Dominique! They’ve killed Dominique!
He moans.
AXEL
Listen, you’re super-intelligent right, so you should be able to
compute that we are in a world of shit. You have to help me,
otherwise we’re toast. Is that what you want?
UIQ (hologram)
You have to help me. What you are asking would be a catastrophe for me. If I am separated from Janice, it’s as though she
were dead. Because if she’s gone, I ... I won’t be able to find
this ... this me that I am with her.

190

AXEL
You’re wrong. Don’t worry, it’ll be fine.
UIQ
You really want to break the contact?
AXEL
Let me finish and listen to what I’m saying. I’ll start again
using the same strain as relay (he indicates the sample). I’ll set
up a new lab...
UIQ
And will Janice be there?
AXEL
I promise you, she’ll be there.
UIQ
And Steve, Jennifer, the others? Manou?
AXEL
I guarantee it!
UIQ
Because if I lose Janice, it will be horrible, more horrible than
any human could possibly imagine. I will be left with nothing
but pain. And pain … when you have no body, no way to
locate it, limit it, and no way to die, no way to end...
AXEL
Yeah, I know all that. Come on!

191

UIQ
No wait... Don’t leave ... me. What happened? I need to
understand.
AXEL (exasperated )
Look, up to now we’ve managed to overcome all the problems,
no? I mean what was it in the end? Just a bit of jealousy, that’s
all. It’s nothing. I say we wait till everything’s calmed down and
next time we try and look at it from another angle.
UIQ (hologram)
Yes, from another angle. There should have been more
humour in our relationship, other images. The guy I killed.
It’s serious, isn’t it? I don’t mean for him. He’s of no account.
But for Janice... Will she still love me after what I’ve done?
AXEL
Look, forget about that for now!
ERIC
No, they haven’t killed Francis and Dominique.
(He brandishes two pieces of mirror). Look, they’re here.
AXEL (to Eric)
Listen Eric, you have to help me, I need you. Don’t make it any
more complicated, please. You have to stop dreaming!
Eric flips. Suddenly he starts to speak normally, with authority.
ERIC (to the UIQ hologram)
Come on, we have to go. You bring Dominique and I’ll
take Francis.
(He holds up the two slivers of mirror) You see them?

192

UIQ (hologram)
Yes, I see them.
ERIC
Alright, so get them. And we’ll meet downstairs.
Bruno bursts into the laboratory. Reeling, almost beside himself
with rage, he shoves Axel violently out of the way and lunges at
the bacteria sample. Axel tries to prevent him, Bruno throws him
to the ground with incredible force and grabs a Bunsen burner.
He lights up the burner and torches the sample.
AXEL
No, don’t do it!
Both UIQ’s hologram and its face are consumed in a garland of
rosy flames. Eric grabs a hammer and hits Bruno on the head from
behind. Bruno spins around and turns the burner on Eric’s hand,
making him drop the hammer. Eric responds immediately with a
series of vicious headbutts.
AXEL (to Eric)
Forget him. Come on!
The laboratory catches fire. Trapped by the flames, the monkey
emits a series of high pitched squeals as it burns. From the courtyard we hear the stampede of boots and the sound of weapons being
cocked as the police mount another charge.
AXEL
Eric, come on!
Eric ignores him. With his clothes on fire, he continues to hit
Bruno who gradually weakens. Dawn begins to break as Axel
makes his escape across the roofs of the burning factory buildings.

International Commission – Int. – Day
In the control room, the whole complex apparatus of screens and
computers lies deserted. The commission members are gathered
around a nearby table, listening intently to the President.
PRESIDENT
Gentlemen, it seems that all disturbances have now ceased. Nonetheless I suggest you continue to exercise the utmost vigilance.
MEMBER OF THE COMMISSION
Certainly, Mr. President.
ANOTHER MEMBER
Yes, but why if you say we’ve nailed it?
PRESIDENT
Well, currently we are seeing an alarming rise in the incidence
of ... heu ... of purpura.
He turns towards a scientist.
SCIENTIST
It’s a vascular illness, usually quite benign, but what we’re seeing
now appears to be a new strain we’ve never encountered before.
PRESIDENT
We’ll have to alert the WHO!
SCIENTIST
But Mr. President, they are the ones who actually contacted us;
they can’t figure out what’s causing this bizarre epidemic.

194

ANOTHER EXPERT
Mr. President, I should tell you that what we are witnessing is
an altogether exceptional phenomenon. Let me show you
something.
The expert presents a series of photos of afflicted people whose faces
are covered in marks that themselves take the form of a face.
The commission members look shocked as they recognizing the face
of UIQ the way it had appeared on the TV screens.
PRESIDENT
Yes, it is as you say, bizarre. Quite bizarre.

Apartment – Int. – Day
In a bare room Jennifer sits in lotus position. Manou arrives and
kneels down, hugging Jennifer and laying her head on her shoulder.
Jennier interrupts her meditation and speaks softly to the child.
JENNIFER
What is it?
MANOU
Where’s Janice?
JENNIFER
I don’t know. She’ll be back.
Manou slips her hand under Jennifer’s sweatshirt and moves it
across her back. Feeling something odd, she stops.
MANOU
What’s that?

195

Jennifer tries to reach round to touch her back. Unable to reach
the spot, she removes her sweatshirt and goes to look in a mirror.
She screams, as she perceives what appear to be scales growing out
of her spine.

Hospital – Int. – Day
We see the clenched face of a convulsing infant which a doctor
covers in an oxygen mask. The body of the child resembles that of a
fish. Another doctor enters the room brandishing a sheet of paper.
DOCTOR
It’s the opposite of what we thought. Hyper-oxygenation.
The doctor removes the oxygen mask from the baby who, of its own
accord, jumps into a nearby bathtub. The doctor opens the taps.
As the bath fills the baby begins to leap and frolic like a salmon.

Hospital – Ext. – Day
Several ambulances converge in front of the emergency department. Stretchers bearing men, women and children, their heads
submerged in basins of water, are carried into the hospital.
DOCTOR
It’s amazing, the speed at which their lungs transform themselves into gills.
NURSE
What’s even more shocking is how these new mutants seems
to have become impervious to fatigue, heat, cold, even pain.
DOCTOR
That’s probably the result of excess endorphins. We’ll have to
alter the dosage.

196

International Commission – Int. – Day
The spokesman sits behind his desk. A secretary hydrates him
constantly with a large sponge.
SPOKESMAN
...Believe me when I say I understand your situation and
sympathize entirely. Now tell me again, quickly, what your
demands are, because I don’t have much time.
We see Robert, with the shaggy, drooping ears of a dog.
ROBERT (barking)
Look, it’s not rocket science, and we’re not backing down.
This is what we want: closure of all isolation camps and
dog pounds...
STEVE
Yes, it’s completely illegal.
Steve has the eyes of a fly. The image he sees appears multiplied into
myriad cells like a beehive.
ROBERT
Secondly, an end to all professional interdictions and sexual
discrimination in the workplace. Third, we want bird perches
in all lifts.
Several telephones begin to ring. The spokesman picks up one of
the receivers.
SPOKESMAN
Hello! Yes, can you just hold on one moment?
(To the secretary) Water, water, I’m drying up!

197

The secretary hydrates him with renewed dilligence. As a sign of
thanks he taps her on the bottom with one of his tentacles.
SECRETARY
Oh! Mr Spokesman!
Outside in the corridor Robert and Steve prepare to leave. Fred
hails them from a distance.
FRED
Steve! Robert!
They turn round.
FRED (scrutinizing them)
My god, you too!
STEVE
And what about you? Nothing?
Fred examines himself.
FRED
Not that I know of. For the moment at least!
ROBERT
You didn’t see Jennifer?
A snail moves slowly along Robert’s arm. Fred looks stupefied.
ROBERT
What the hell are you doing here anyway?

198

FRED (secretively)
We’re working on it.
STEVE
How so brother?
ROBERT
Whatever it is you say you’re doing, it amounts to a barrel of
horseshit. And until we can make contact with UIQ, that’s all
it will ever be. That’s what I told your head octopus.
FRED
Come with me. I’m so happy to see you guys. But here, for
now everything’s hush hush. Can I count on you?
STEVE
Whatever, man.
Flashing his electronic pass at some armed guards, he guides them
through a maze of subterranean corridors.
FRED
Well what I can tell you is we’ve already re-established contact.
We’ve managed to reconstitute the cyanobacteria and set up
the lab again.
ROBERT
So why didn’t you say so?
FRED
Because the situation hasn’t changed. We can’t get anything out
of the obstinate little fuck.
They arrive at armour-plated doors.

199

FRED
Hello, this is Fred Newman, I’m with Robert Muhler and Steve
Johnson...
VOICE-OFF
Who are they?
FRED
Two guys from the commune, old friends of UIQ. They could
be useful.
VOICE-OFF
With the way things are right now I don’t see why not. Ok,
they can come in!
The automatic doors slide open. Inside are around fifteen people,
technical experts and other members of the commission, several of
them mutants. They turn towards Robert and Steve.
On the video screen of the electron microscope the familiar cellular
corpuscles pulse with light. There is no other image.
FRED
Nothing new?
GUY
Nothing. We have contact, but that’s about all.
STEVE
You sure it’s UIQ? I mean you sure it’s our main motherfucker.
FRED
It’s him alright. No doubt about it.
He sits down in front of a microphone.

200

FRED
Listen, UIQ. Steve and Robert are here, you remember them,
don’t you want to say hello?
Superimposed upon the cellular blobs appear the words “No comment.” Fred turns towards Steve and Robert.
FRED
It’s eight days he’s been like that. No comment, No fucking
comment. It’s all we can squeeze out of him.
Robert approaches the microphone.
ROBERT
UIQ, it’s me, Robert. Listen we used to be friends didn’t we.
If you even remember what that means, you can’t go on like
this, you have to do something to get us out of this. Look what
I’ve become. Look at my face. And look what you’ve done to
Jennifer. You remember Jennifer, don’t you? Well, take a look.
We hear the sound of quiet sniggering, as the blobs seem to form
themselves into a face.
All those present in the room burst into a round of applause.
GUY
It reacted, it reacted!
ROBERT
What’s with you?
FRED
He responded, we’re in business.

201

ROBERT
You call that a response.
(To UIQ) Listen you little asswipe, there are millions of us
here, all disfigured, mutilated, broken and you think it’s a joke.
Once again the same phrase, “No comment,” appears on the screen.
The image goes back to how it was before.
The others are furious with Robert.
TECHNICIAN
You’ve screwed up everything! You mustn’t talk to it like that.
ANOTHER TECHNICIAN
Laying a guilt trip on the little guy. If he keeps pulling shit like
that we’re fucked.
ROBERT
Hey, who do you think you’re talking to, four-eyes. We’re from
the National Delegation of Mutants!
The technician signals him to shut up, lifting his shirt to reveal
something we cannot see but which must be pretty horrible judging
from Robert and Steve’s reaction. Steve tries to stop himself
from retching.
ROBERT
Oh well, if you put it like that, I’m sorry comrade.
(To UIQ) That amuses you too does it? Aren’t you ashamed?
It’s intolerable, that’s what it is. We demand you take whatever
measures are necessary to restore each of us to ... to...

202

PATIENT
Their original look.
ROBERT
Yes, of course, their look!
EXPERT (aside to Fred )
Your buddy is a complete nutjob.
FRED (irritated )
No, he’s a good guy. He’s straight up and UIQ trusts him.
EXPERT (to Robert)
Thanks for your efforts. You’ve been a great help.
Steve pushes Robert out of the way to take his place.
STEVE
Look UIQ, I know where you’re coming from. I got nothing
to say to the contrary.
Close-up of Steve’s fly-eyes, on whose facets we see multiplied
images of members of the commission, many afflicted with
mutations, holding their heads in despair.
STEVE
You did what you thought you had to do. And maybe in your
place I would have been just as badass. But we have to rethink
the situation here. We have to find another angle to approach
it. Because what is this all about when you get down to it?
Come on, we’re among friends here so let’s talk about it, you
had a little episode, a little crisis...
On the facets of Steve’s eyes, several commission members point
their fingers to their temples to indicate a screw is loose.

203

STEVE
And you know jealousy, the good ol’ green-eyed motherfucker,
well that can lead to some pretty fucked up shit.
ROBERT
Yes, it always leads to the worst stupidities, starting with capitalism!
FRED
Wait ... let Steve speak.
STEVE
You gotta listen up because what I gotta say to you now is
going to sound like some pretty heavy shit. When you made
contact with us, you were like ... like a little baby, you thought
it was all going to be easy as pie and it’s true, what passed
between us all, everything we did, it was some amazing shit.
But then you fell in love with Janice and everything went ass
up. And in a sense that was cool, it was the norm, you weren’t
prepared for it. I don’t know how it goes down in your universe
but here on planet Earth, love is always the kind of weird-ass
shit that drives a motherfucker crazy.
All of a sudden, superimposed on the image of corpuscles there
appear in quick succession a square, a circle, a triangle and then
a single word “Janice,” followed by a rapid blur of figures and
algorithms. Everyone rises from their seat. The emotion in the
room is intense.
EXPERT
Transmit those formulae to the decoding department immediately!

Hospital Corridor and Room – Int. – Day
Uniformed guards stand watch at the door to a hospital room. A
nurse arrives pushing a trolley. One of them opens the door for her.

204

Inside is Janice dressed in a simple white bedshirt. Axel, seemingly
in a state of collaspe, sits on the bed next to her.
In a corner of the room, the President of the commission paces up
and down.
NURSE (to Axel )
I’m afraid you must leave now. I have to shave her.
AXEL
No, no way. I’m not going.
JANICE
If you don’t mind I prefer to do it myself.
She grabs the shaving equipment.
NURSE
As you like.
The nurse goes out.
AXEL
You can’t let them do it.
PRESIDENT (to Axel )
What option do we have? He says he will only speak to her,
directly, and without intermediaries. This ... operation is the
condition for returning things to normality. Bears thinking
about, wouldn’t you say? I cannot say how grateful we are that
Miss Janice Cellini has agreed to this ... I won’t say sacrifice ...
no, to this magnificent act of boundless altruism!

205

JANICE (wearily)
Why don’t you show your appreciation by shutting your trap.
PRESIDENT
Very well, very well.
AXEL
I can’t accept this intervention. What you’re suggesting, what
you want to do to her is completely fucking crazy. We have to
wait, however long it takes we just have to wait. UIQ needs us,
he won’t have any choice but to speak to us and when he does,
everything will sort itself out. But this ... this intercerebral
operation is just totally unacceptable...
PRESIDENT
Calm down, young man. I understand your feelings, you think
we should wait but for how long? How many more mutations
do you think can we cope with? You know how many there are
per day right now? 17 million. I’m afraid we cannot afford to
wait any longer. So...
(He turns towards Janice) It is a magnificent gesture that you
have chosen to make, young lady, truly magnificent!
JANICE
If you think I give a shit about your 17 million freaks!
PRESIDENT
I understand how you feel, believe me, I do.
AXEL
You’re right. What the hell do we care. Forget it. Let’s get the
fuck out of here!

206

PRESIDENT
Now wait a minute, we had an agreement...
JANICE
Don’t worry grandpa. I’m not going to run out on you...
PRESIDENT
Thank you, speaking for all of us, thank you again.
JANICE
Now get the fuck out of my face.
The President retreats from the room.
PRESIDENT
Of course, of course.
Janice gets up, takes the electric razor and begins to shave her head
in front of the mirror. Clumps of hair fall to the ground. Axel
begins to cry.
JANICE
Leave it, Axel. Go. It’s hard enough for me as it is. Don’t make
it any worse.
AXEL
Why are you giving in to this bullshit blackmail? We just have
to wait until he calms down, that’s all.
JANICE
You don’t get it, do you? It’s between him and me. He’ll never
accept anyone else interfering.
The door opens. An official enters bearing a sheaf of papers.

207

HOSPITAL OFFICIAL
If you just sign here and here... It’s a pure formality.
JANICE
Give me the pen.
She signs.
JANICE
And now I want to be alone.
Bewildered and defeated, Axel allows himself to be led out of the
room by the nurse and the official.

Hospital Corridor / Operating Theatre – Int. – Day
Asleep and her head-shaven, Janice is pushed on a trolley towards
the operating theatre where the team of surgeons is ready. They
examine a screen with an electronic diagram of the brain where
we can see a large number of small luminous dots. A surgeon draws
a grid pattern on Janice’s skull.
Another surgeon manipulates a set of micro-implants with tiny
pliers. Against the light, he observes the micro-implants shimmering in the test tubes. They look like some kind of iron filings.
SURGEON (to his assistant)
Christ! I wouldn’t want that implanted in my noodle!
ASSISTANT
But tell me, professor ... will it be completely irreversible?
SURGEON
Of that there isn’t the slightest doubt!

208

He raises his arms to the sky. They call him to start the operation.
SURGEON
Let’s get this over with!
On a scanner we see sharp needles penetrating deeply into the brain.

Hospital Room – Int. – Day
In silence, Janice studies herself in a mirror. Her head, completey
shorn, bears the scars of the recent operation,
She remains there motionless, very close to the mirror’s surface,
indifferent to the clouding of her breath. Extreme close-up of her
eyes, the pupils dilated in an expression of extreme anguish.
A succession of shots of Janice, immobile in a chair, looking out the
window. A stubble of hair beginning to sprout.
Behind her are Axel, Fred, Robert. They move their lips as if
speaking but their words remain unheard.

Hospital Garden – Ext. – Day
Barefoot, Janice walks along a path wearing only a bedshirt. She
runs her hand over her head, her hair still no more than a shadow
of stubble.
JANICE
We’re going home... What did he say? He’ll be back tomorrow.
What did he say? Tomorrow.
By the time she utters these last words, Janice’s voice has completely
changed. It’s now a guttural, male voice.

209

Street – Ext. – Day
Strangely the road is deserted, sun blasted.
VOICE OFF (monotonous but with occasional changes in timbre)
No, not now... They are still making noise... Do you hear?
I should have told her... He had given it to me... Time for
tea... It was higher... Iʼd have kept some... It goes on...
Behind the door...
We realise it is Janice speaking as she walks.
JANICE
I didnʼt know... He came back... She will wash... He speaks
to me... Heʼs there I think... Heʼll be interested in that ... at
home ... no, itʼs not my fault if I didnʼt tell her, itʼs that I didnʼt see him... I think Iʼm going ... itʼs not the same thing ... he
did no wrong... But itʼs a long story, a long time ... leave me
the bottle... I would have liked to...
She arrives at the road leading down to the factory.
They all left... Itʼs not the same... Weʼre going to give her...
She has so many... I really wanted to... We will have the time...
It annoys them... It doesn’t matter... She didnʼt see anything...
Maybe Iʼm expecting ... in that case ... it might change something... Theyʼll have put up curtains ... there are eyes ... if you
like...
She comes to the flat roof. We see that she is sweating despite
having made almost no effort. With an impassive air, she unbuttons
her bedshirt.
Wait ... we sorted them... I said so... No, not that... I remember... She looked at it...
Calmly, she walks along the edge.

210

Itʼs possible ... he wanted ... I donʼt know where I put it ... he
talked a lot ... to start over ... grey and blue...
Emotionless, she stares into space.
He would have... Thereʼs no reason... We can wait for him...
Itʼs possible.
She falls head first into the void.
We hear the dull crack of her body as it hits concrete.
A few seconds later, a pool of blood begins to form around
her head. Silently she gets up, passes a hand over her skull and
walks away.
(Monotonous) Might he give her back her death at least.

THE END

211
